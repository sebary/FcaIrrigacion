abstract = {Tyteca [J. Environ. Manage. 46 (1996) 281] reviews the literature on environmental performance indicators. In that paper he calls for an index that simultaneously accounts for resources used, good outputs produced and pollutants or undesirable outputs emitted. Here, we provide a formal index number of environmental performance which can be computed using data envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques. The implicit benchmark is that of finding the highest ratio of good to bad outputs. Our environmental performance index is constructed from distance functions which implies that it satisfies a number of desirable properties. Since the component distance functions require only information on input and output quantities, the fact that bad outputs typically are not marketed and therefore have no readily observable 'price' poses no obstacle. We apply our method to a sample of OECD countries for 1990. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The estimates of capital input are derived by representing capital stock as a weighted sum of past investments. The weights correspond to the relative efficiencies of capital goods of different ages, so that the weighted components of capital stock have the same efficiency. We convert estimates of capital stock into estimates of capital services by means of capital rental prices. Comparisons of levels of capital input among countries require data on relative prices of capital input. We obtain relative price levels for capital input among countries via relative investment goods prices, taking into account the flow of capital input per unit of capital stock in each country.},

abstract = {Stubble farming (conservation farming, minimum tillage, zero tillage) has increased in Australia over several decades with claims of improved productivity, landscape stability and environmental benefit including ecosystem services downstream, yet recent audits show a dramatic and general decline in river health. This review explores explanations for this apparent anomaly. Many confounding factors complicate interactions between land use and river condition and may disguise or over-ride the potential benefits of adoption of stubble systems or other improvements in agricultural land use practice. These factors include climate change and variability; land use changes including an increase in bushfires, growth of farm dams and afforestation; lag times between land use change and expression of benefits in river systems; use of inappropriate scale that disguises local benefit; variations in the extent of ecosystem resilience; impacts of river regulation; and impacts of introduced species. Additionally, the value of river condition and utility is complicated by different local or regional perceptions and by contrasting rural and urban outlooks. The use of indicators, risk frameworks and biophysical modelling may help elucidate the complex relationships between land use and downstream ecosystem impact. The strengthening of local, regional and catchment scale approaches is advocated. This includes the re-integration of land management and governance with water management and planning. It is encouraging that farmers are themselves developing systems to optimise trade-offs between on-farm activities and ecosystem service benefits. This approach needs to be supported and extended. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Summary. - For 15 years Chile has been the leading international example of pro-market policies for water resources, and its 1981 Water Code has recently been touted as a model for other countries to follow. Water markets are controversial in both theory and practice: their potential benefits include greater efficiency and flexibility of water use and less state intervention and expenditure; while their drawbacks include social and environmental externalities, vulnerability to high transactions costs, and other common examples of market failure. No country has taken the experiment as far as Chile, since its Water Code privatized water rights, reduced state administration, and attempted to stimulate a free market in water rights. The results have been mixed and uneven. The lesson of the Chilean case is that setting up water markets is harder and more complicated than it may seem, even in the fairly simple arena of irrigation transfers.},

abstract = {One of the foremost objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the European Union (EU) is to increase agricultural productivity through subsidization of farmers. However, little empirical research has been done to examine the effect of subsidies on farm performance and, in particular, the channels through which subsidies affect productivity. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model in which input productivity, efficiency change, and technical change depend on subsidies and other factors, including farm location, we analyze empirically how subsidies affect the performance of farms. We use an unbalanced panel from the EU's Farm Accountancy Data Network on Danish, Finnish, and Swedish dairy farms and partition the data into eight regions. The data set covers the period 1997-2003 and has a total of 6,609 observations. The results suggest that subsidies drive productivity through efficiency and input productivities and the magnitudes of these effects differ across regions. In contrast to existing studies, we find that subsidies have a positive impact on technical efficiency. The contribution of subsidies to output is largest for dairy farms in Denmark and Southern, Central, and Northern Sweden. {\textcopyright} 2008 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Within this sector about 90{\%} of the water consumption is based on green water – rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture. • The greatest opportunity for improvement in water productivity and efficiency is in rain-fed agriculture through enhanced and known management practices. • In general, irrigation efficiency of the existing systems in LAC countries is medium to low; the average irrigation efficiency for the region is reported at 39{\%}, varying between 30 and 40{\%}, whereas the world average is 56{\%}. • Urban water use in LAC also shows low technical water efficiency relative to developed countries; on average, water conveyance efficiency is reported to be 59{\%}. • Water efficiency in the electricity sector also shows significant room for improvement. • Thus LAC countries must improve water use efficiencies in order to increase water and food security as well as protect aquatic ecosystems. LAC countries must consider water policy changes that provide adequate incentives to use water resources efficiently and ultimately achieve a more sustainable use of water in all sectors.},

abstract = {The achievement of sustainable irrigation in arid regions requires greater attention to waterlogging, salinization, and degradation of ground and surface waters, which are among the problems that continue to threaten productivity and degrade environmental quality. We consider sustainability to be achieved when irrigation and drainage are conducted on-farm, and within irrigation districts, in a manner that does not degrade the quality of land, water, and other natural resources, either on-farm or throughout an irrigated region. Sustainability may also be described as maintaining the productive resources required for irrigation, so that future generations may have the same opportunity to use those resources as we do. Given the increasing importance of irrigated land for food production, the time has come when it is vital to intercept, reuse, and isolate drainage waters within the regions in which they are generated. Adoption of this strategy can be enhanced by policies that require farmers, and irrigation districts, to consider the off-farm impacts of irrigation and drainage. Such policies include linking water rights with salt rights to require the monitoring and management of both irrigation water and the salt loads in drainage waters. We review the knowledge gained since the early 1970s regarding the economic and agronomic aspects of irrigation and drainage, with a focus on drainage water reduction and sequential reuse of drainage water on salt-tolerant crops. Economic incentives that motivate farm-level and district-level improvements in water management are also reviewed. We conclude that adequate knowledge exists for implementing strategies that focus on water use and salt disposal within irrigated regions, and we recommend policies that will motivate improvements in productivity and enhance the likelihood of achieving sustainability.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Due to the large volume of sewage in China, the efficiency of water consumption evaluated by the traditional model may be inaccurate. This paper evaluates the water consumption efficiency more scientifically. First, this paper uses the CCR model to evaluate the resource efficiency and environmental efficiency separately. The latter is generally lower than the former, which means the issue of water pollution is more serious than the problem of water resource consumption. Then, the water consumption efficiency is integrally evaluated by an eco-inefficiency model which focuses on undesirable outputs. The results are in good agreement with the results of the CCR model: (1) Only Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai are eco-efficient in terms of water consumption, water consumption efficiency in the southeastern coastal areas is higher than in the Midwest, and the overall water environment is bad; (2) China needs to focus on reducing industrial wastewater; (3) the output of water consumption has a lot of room for improvement; and (4) the output improvement schemes of all provinces have some similarities and are related to many features. So, this paper has made a clustering analysis of the improvement schemes and given detailed suggestions for improving the eco-efficiency of water consumption in China according to the clustering result.},

abstract = {Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have become an issue of global contamination concern. PBDEs have been used extensively over the past two decades as additive brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in most types of polymers applied to electronic equipment, plastics, textiles, building materials, carpets, vehicles and aircrafts (Allchin et al., 1999). BFRs are used to prevent ignition of the polymer and to slow the initial phase of combustion. However, they are one of the most prominent and persistent environmental pollutants, which have adverse effects on human health and wild life. Little information is found in the international literature on PBDEs in environmental systems of South America. It includes information about PBDEs presence in salmon and air samples from Chile (Pozo et al., 2004; Montory and Barra, 2006); and skipjack tuna and human breast adipose tissue from Brazil (Ueno et al., 2004; Kalantzi et al., 2009). Nevertheless there is not information about PBDEs in Argentina. The aim of the present work was to investigate PBDEs presence in Argentine environment. The first approach was across the study of the sediment of Mendoza River basin and El Carrizal reservoir. Additional physico-chemical analysis, including sample pH, electrical conductivity (C.E.), total organic matter (O.M) and characterization of the organic matter by infrared spectrometry were carried out. The information was analyzed using multivariate analysis in order to identify a possible correlation between those variables and presence of PBDEs for the analyzed samples. The working hypothesis was: PBDEs levels and distribution in the basin are related to anthropogenic intervention.},

It proposes a theoretical model, and numerically derives general results for a simplified case with homogeneous users. The model is applied to aquifers in Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico and in Kern County, California. We propose a method to compare the performance of a new, innovative policy intervention—decoupling the subsidy from the electricity bill—with two traditional policy interventions, elimination and reduction of the subsidy. The results suggest that the rate of water extraction of and the level of water in the aquifer, which are undesirable under the existing electricity subsidy, can be improved by changing the subsidy structure. Furthermore, decoupling represents a politically feasible alternative to solving the overexploitation of groundwater due to electricity subsidies.},

abstract = {Australian wine grape growers have faced difficult market conditions in recent years, with reductions in grape prices and increases in irrigation water prices having a significant effect on farm profitability. The need for these farmers to be as efficient as possible has never been greater. In this exploratory study we use a subset of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) irrigation survey, consisting of four years of unbalanced panel data on 135 wine grape growers (214 observations in total) from the Murray and Murrumbidgee River basins in Australia (from 2006/07 to 2009/10), to estimate production frontiers and estimate the efficiency levels of the individual farmers. Maximum likelihood methods are used to estimate translog stochastic frontier production frontiers. Mean technical efficiency is estimated to be 79 percent, with the many farms achieving well below this level facing tough times ahead if grape prices do not improve. A mean scale economies estimate of 1.07 is obtained, indicating that further farm amalgamations may be warranted. Finally, shadow price estimates for irrigation water are found to be (on average) above market prices, suggesting that current irrigation practices may need to be reassessed. However, this result is likely influenced by the presence of drought during the sample years.},

Almost 100{\%} of raspberry production is exported, and the cultivation of this crop has put pressure on smallholder farmers to integrate into the modern agri-food chain system. The goal of this article is to analyze technical efficiency (TE) levels for a sample of 139 small-scale raspberry farmers in the Maule region of Chile, the main production area for this crop in the country. One focus of this study is to evaluate the association between TE -understood as an indicator of managerial performance- and farmers' decisions to sell their production directly to the agri- industry or indirectly through an informal middleman. Using a stochastic production frontier model we find that the commercialization decision plays an important role in the productivity and revenue of small-scale raspberry producers. The analysis also reveals a positive relationship between TE levels and income among experienced and trained farmers. The role of implementing food quality and safety standards on farm income is also discussed.},

abstract = {Coordination between the water, energy, food and environment sectors is challenging even at the national level. But the complexity increases substantially in transboundary river basins where the impacts spread from one country to another and trade-offs and externalities may cause friction between the riparian countries. The "nexus approach" to managing interlinked resources has emerged as a way to enhance water, energy and food security by increasing efficiency, reducing trade-offs, building synergies and improving governance, while protecting ecosystems. Despite the increasing recognition of the importance of interlinkages and dependencies between sectors, the nexus approach commonly remains abstract or at the level of political statements. Work on the nexus at the transboundary level is very rare. Reconciling resource uses in transboundary basins: assessment of the water-food-energy-ecosystems nexus explores new ground by applying a systematic approach to determine what is entailed in the water-food-energy-ecosystems nexus in transboundary basins. On the basis of a practically-oriented and participatory assessment, this work shows the tangible benefits of intersectoral coordination and transboundary cooperation. Carried out in the framework of the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention), with the leadership of Finland, the assessment of the water-food-energy-ecosystems nexus aims to promote transboundary cooperation by identifying intersectoral synergies that could be further explored and utilized, and determines policy measures and actions that could alleviate tensions or conflicts related to the multiple uses of and needs for common resources. The nexus assessment is also intended to assist countries in optimizing their use of resources, to increase efficiency and to ensure greater policy coherence and co-management. To this end, the methodology developed for the assessment is applicable to very different basins with very different conditions, providing a framework flexible enough for global use and yet adapting to specific conditions and issues at stake.},

abstract = {We argue analytically that many commonly used models of pollution-generating technologies, which treat pollution as a freely disposable input or as a weakly disposable and null-joint output, may generate unacceptable implications for the trade-offs among inputs, outputs, and pollution. We show that the correct trade-offs in production are best captured if a pollution-generating technology is modeled as an intersection of an intended-production technology of the firm and nature's residual-generation set. The former satisfies standard disposability properties, while the latter violates free (strong) disposability of pollution and pollution-causing inputs. As a result, the intersection—which we call a by-production technology—violates standard free disposability of pollution and pollution-causing inputs. Employing data envelopment analysis on an electric-power-plant database, we illustrate shortcomings, under by-production, of two popular efficiency indexes: the hyperbolic and directional-distance-function indexes. We propose and implement an alternative index with superior properties. Under by-production, most efficiency indexes decompose very naturally into intended-production and environmental efficiency indexes. This decomposition is difficult to find under alternative specifications of pollution-generating technologies.},

abstract = {Abstract Environmental public goods—including national parks, clean air/water, and ecosystem ser- vices—provide substantial benefits on a global scale. These goods have unique characteristics in that they are typically “nonmarket” goods, with values from both use and passive use that accrue to a large number of individuals both in current and future generations. In this study, we test the hypothesis that neural signals in areas correlated with subjective valuations for essentially all other previously studied categories of goods (ventromedial pre-frontal cortex and ventral striatum) also correlate with environmental valuations.We use contingent valuation (CV) as our behavioral tool formeasuring valuations of environmental public goods. CV is a standard stated preference approach that presents survey respondents with information on an issue and asks questions that help policymakers determine how much citizens are willing to pay for a public good or policy. Wescanned human subjects while they viewed environmental proposals, along with three other classes of goods. The presentation of all four classes of goods yielded robust and similar patterns of temporally synchronized brain activation within attentionalnetworks. The activations associated with the traditional classes of goods replicate previous correlations between neural activity in valuation areas and behavioral preferences. In contrast, CV-elicited values for environmental proposals did not correlate with brain activity at either the individual or population level. For a sub-population of participants, CV-elicited values were correlated with activity within the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, a region associated with cognitive control and shifting decision strategies. The results show that neural activity associated with the subjective valuation of environmental proposals differs profoundly from the neural activity associated with previously examined goods and preference measures.},

abstract = {Three data sets derived from 5- or 6-year field experiments at Merbein (Victoria), Dareton (New South Wales) and Loxton (South Australia) were used to assess the relationship between yield of own-rooted or grafted grapevines and electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste extract (ECe). This involved a non-linear least squares fit method to determine the threshold of ECe it which yield begins to decline and the slope of the yield reduction with increasing ECe above that threshold. Threshold and slope are the two key parameters in this piecewise linear model of grapevine response to salinity. The soil ECe values were integrated to take account of both spatial and temporal variation in soil salinity within the profile. The ECe threshold for own-rooted Sultana at Merbein in the Sunraysia region was found to be 2.3 +/- 0.2 dS/m and the slope of yield reduction above the threshold was 8.9 +/- 1.2 {\%} per 1 dS/m increase in soil ECe. At Dareton, a similar threshold of 2.1 +/- 0.3 dS/m was found for own-rooted Sultana, however the higher slope of the yield reduction (15.0 +/- 2.0 {\%}) relative to the same vines at Merbein may have been related to the higher sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in irrigation water and its impacts on soil physical properties, especially in that part of the vineyard with a heavier soil type. The rootstock Ramsey resulted in a threshold of 3.3 +/- 0.2 dS/m and slope of 5.7 +/- 0.4 {\%} with the scion Colombard at Loxton, indicating a more tolerant combination of scion-rootstock to salinity. The rootstocks 1103 Paulsen and R2 with Sultana as scion were the most salt tolerant, with no discernible yield reduction until ECe exceeded about 4 dS/m. Of four other rootstocks with Sultana as scion, compared with own-rooted sultana, J17-69, and R4 had similar threshold values (2.3 +/- 0.2 and 2.5 +/- 0.2 dS/m) and slopes of yield reduction (10.1 +/- 1.9 {\%} and 8.0 +/- 0.5 {\%}, respectively), while R1 had a similar threshold of 1.8 +/- 0.2 dS/m but a lower slope of yield reduction (4.3 +/- 0.9 {\%}) than Sultana on own roots and R3, J17-69, R1 and R4 rootstocks. Comparatively, R3 rootstock responded differently by way of a higher threshold of 3.0 +/- 0.2 dS/m than own-rooted Sultana and J17-69 and R1 rootstocks and a higher slope of yield reduction of 12.4 +/- 1.0 {\%} relative to Sultana on own roots and R4 and R1 rootstocks. Based on our long-term studies of yield-salinity relationships on contrasting sites, the pre-eminence of certain rootstocks in conferring tolerance to soil salinity has been confirmed. Ramsey, 1103 Paulsen, and a new hybrid designed here as R3 were generally outstanding, with Ramsey varying only slightly in its comparative effectiveness when grafted to different scion varieties. An overall interaction between scion variety and rootstock genotype was thus evident in the form of yield-salinity relationships.},

abstract = {Most existing economic analyses of optimal groundwater management use single-cell aquifer models, which assume that an aquifer responds uniformly and instantly to groundwater pumping. In this paper, we develop an economic model of groundwater management that explicitly incorporates spatial dynamic groundwater flow equations. Calibration of our model to published economic studies of specific aquifers demonstrates that existing studies generally incorrectly estimate the magnitude of the groundwater pumping externality relative to spatially explicit models. In particular, for large aquifers with surface areas of thousands of square miles, the marginal pumping externality predicted by single-cell models may be orders of magnitude less than that predicted by a spatially explicit model, even at large distances from a pumping well. Conversely, for small aquifers with areas of a few hundred square miles or less, single-cell models reasonably approximate the pumping externality. Application of single-cell models to inappropriate settings may result in misleading policy implications due to understatement of the magnitude and spatial nature of the groundwater externality. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It becomes clear that the current low price of agricultural groundwater use is inefficient and provides fewer incentives for the adoption of modern irrigation technology than does a system that considers the cost of desiccation and contam- ination in the price of water. It also becomes clear that internalisation of the negative as well as positive externalities from agri- cultural shallow groundwater extraction on stock quality in the price of groundwater is particularly significant if the recharge of groundwater is large compared with stock size. This impact will be- come smaller if stock size increases, due to the dilution effect. If these externalities are not inter- nalised in the price of groundwater, contamina- tion will be accelerated and quality improvements will be slowed down.},

Based on a sample of 347 wheat growers in the Guanzhong Plain, this paper simultaneously estimates a production function, and its corresponding first-order conditions for cost minimization, to analyze efficiency of irrigation water use. The main findings are that average technical, allocative, and overall economic efficiency are 0.35, 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. In a second stage analysis, we find that farmers' perception of water scarcity, water price and irrigation infrastructure increase irrigation water allocative efficiency, while land fragmentation decreases it. We also show that farmers' income loss due to higher water prices can be offset by increasing irrigation water use efficiency.},

In this stage we estimate the impact of each explanatory variable on environmental efficiency, and we derive conditional estimates of environmental efficiency from the one-sided error component. We illustrate our methodology with an empirical application to a panel of Dutch dairy farms. We find evidence of relatively low levels of environmental efficiency, and we find that environmental efficiency can be improved through a number of policy options, including the provision of farmers with more insight into the nutrient balance of their farms.},

abstract = {We examine the effects of energy prices on groundwater extraction using an econometric model of a farmer's irrigation water pumping decision that accounts for both the intensive and extensive margins. Our results show that energy prices have an effect on both types of margins. Increasing energy prices would affect crop selection decisions,crop acreage allocation decisions,and farmers' demand for water. Our estimated total marginal effect, which sums the effects on the intensive and extensive margins, suggests that a {\$}1 per million btu increase in the energy price would decrease water extraction by an individual farmer by 5.89 acre-feet per year, a decrease of 3.6 percent of the average annual extraction rate. Our estimated elasticity of water extraction with respect to energy price is −0.26.},

abstract = {This is an age of transition in groundwater policy. The ownership and control of aquifers, changing groundwater quality, and the impact of groundwater on the environment command the attention of policy makers around the globe. Substantial pressure exists for change in the laws and regulations governing groundwater, which are critical to the management of this critical resource. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the practical policy debate from an economic perspective. This study begins by outlining the basic stages of change in groundwater policy and their economic relevance. A set of physical, economic, and institutional indicators are suggested that may help to understand various country issues. The indicators are used to describe some actual experiences in groundwater policy in the United States and Spain that are examined for insights into common policy questions. This study suggests that the public authority to initiate groundwater policy innovations often results from the physical ties between surface and groundwater. In contexts rich with spatial and temporal externalities the situation is more complex, but this increases the social benefits that result from successful reform. A credible threat of losing rights is often necessary to create enough incentives to firm existing rights. Reductions in overall use are better achieved through purchasing and retiring rights, rather than through compensation for nonuse. Finally, the policy issues important to groundwater are often more fundamental than pricing alone. These insights may help policy makers adapt to emerging groundwater management problems.},

Adoption occurs when the landholder perceives that the innovation in question will enhance the achievement of their personal goals. A range of goals is identifiable among landholders, including economic, social and environmental goals. Innovations are more likely to be adopted when they have a high ‘relative advantage' (perceived superiority to the idea or practice that it supersedes), and when they are readily trialable (easy to test and learn about before adoption). Non-adoption or low adoption of a number of conservation practices is readily explicable in terms of their failure to provide a relative advantage (particularly in economic terms) or a range of difficulties that landholders may have in trialing them.},

A new risk-based approach has been implemented to assess the impacts on water, energy and food consumption. This approach incorporates the uncertainties associated with supply-demand balance and seasonal variability. The risk in this paper is defined as the probability of exceeding acceptable level of shortage in per capita demand for water, energy and food in any year of the planning period. Using the risk-based approach and the water-energy-food model, the impact of a number of demand management strategies and their-related water-energy-food is investigated in the city of Duhok, Iraq. This is to find the most effective strategy that achieves sustainable supply for water, energy and food. The results show that use of recycled grey water for non-potable applications is able to decrease the risk of exceeding acceptable shortage in water demand but increases the energy demand for water treatment. Additionally, using anaerobic digestion of food waste and wastewater sludge for energy recovery can decrease the risk of exceeding acceptable shortage in energy demand from 55 to 10{\%} in 2026.},

Therefore, in order to evaluate measures to control salinity the SIMGRO integrated regional hydrological model was extended with a module for conservative matter. This modified model was applied to an irrigated area of 2650 ha in the province of Mendoza, Argentina, after being calibrated with data on groundwater levels, evapotranspiration and salinity. The differences between calculated and observed salinity were generally small, except in the root zone, where observed values varied considerably in time and over short distances. Runs with four scenarios revealed that using more groundwater would be a very effective measure for controlling salinity. In subregions with shallow groundwater, improving the drainage system would also be beneficial and has the advantage that there is no risk of overexploiting the aquifers, which are a finite source of good quality water. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Climate change, water supply limits, and continued population growth have intensified the search for measures to conserve water in irrigated agriculture, the world's largest water user. Policy measures that encourage adoption of water-conserving irrigation technologies are widely believed to make more water available for cities and the environment. However, little integrated analysis has been conducted to test this hypothesis. This article presents results of an integrated basin-scale analysis linking biophysical, hydrologic, agronomic, economic, policy, and institutional dimensions of the Upper Rio Grande Basin of North America. It analyzes a series of water conservation policies for their effect on water used in irrigation and on water conserved. In contrast to widely-held beliefs, our results show that water conservation subsidies are unlikely to reduce water use under conditions that occur in many river basins. Adoption of more efficient irrigation technologies reduces valuable return flows and limits aquifer recharge. Policies aimed at reducing water applications can actually increase water depletions. Achieving real water savings requires designing institutional, technical, and accounting measures that accurately track and economically reward reduced water depletions. Conservation programs that target reduced water diversions or applications provide no guarantee of saving water.},

This article addresses this gap by establishing the economic impact associated with a hypothetical greenhouse gas environmental regulatory regime across major dairy producing counties in the United States. In doing so, the article makes three important contributions to the literature. First, it develops a comprehensive pollution index based on Environmental Protection Agency methodologies, which contrasts with previous studies that rely on partial measures based only on surplus nitrogen stemming from the over-application of fertilizer. Second, the article uses a directional output distance function, an approach that has not been employed previously to evaluate polluting technologies in the U.S. dairy sector. Third, the article incorporates a four-way error approach that accounts for unobserved county heterogeneity, time-invariant persistent technical efficiency, time-varying transient technical efficiency, and a random error. The results indicate that regulating greenhouse gas emissions from dairy farming would induce a 5-percentage point increase in average technical efficiency. In addition, the economic costs of implementing this hypothetical regulatory framework exhibit significant spatial variation across counties in the United States.},

@phdthesis{Stewart2005,
abstract = {The increasing demand worldwide for Australian wine has driven the recent expansion in vineyard plantings which in turn, has increased the requirement for irrigation water in grape growing regions. Large areas of Australia's national vineyard are already irrigated with relatively poor quality water and many districts have a limited supply of water available for irrigation. Therefore, improving the efficiency of vineyard irrigation is essential for the long term sustainability of the Australian wine industry. Reducing the volume of irrigation applied to vineyards can improve water use efficiency (WUE) and reduce vine vigour. However, it can be difficult to accurately apply the required degree of water stress and this may result in a yield reduction. An irrigation technique known as partial rootzone drying (PRD) involves applying a continuous water deficit to alternate sides of the root system while ensuring the other half is well watered. This has been found to increase WUE, reduce vine vigour, improve fruit quality but not affect vine yield. Where the soil volume available for root growth is limited, so too is the resultant vine growth and yield, as access to water and nutrients is restricted. Shallow soil profiles present a major limitation to root development and grapevine vigour. In shallow soils, mounding topsoil from the vineyard mid row to form raised beds in the vine row has been found to improve vine growth and productivity. Soil mounds tend to have a higher moisture holding capacity than flat soil but the greater surface area of the mound can increase surface evaporation. Applying mulch to the mound surface has been shown to reduce evaporative soil moisture loss and conserve irrigation water. The general hypothesis tested in this experiment was that: 'Combining soil mounding, straw mulch and partial rootzone drying (PRD) irrigation will improve grapevine growth and production and reduce levels of sodium and chloride in the vine.' The experiment was established on Vitis vinifera cv. Shiraz in a mature vineyard at Padthaway, South Australia, where the soil profile consisted of a shallow loam over clay and limestone. Soils of the experimental site were classified as moderately saline because their electrical conductivity (ECse) was greater than 4 dS/m. Three main factors, irrigation method (standard or PRD), soil mounding (flat or mounded) and surface cover (bare or straw mulch) were combined into a 2X2X2 factorial experiment such that the randomised block experiment comprised three replicates of eight treatments. The irrigation treatments were control (the application of water to both sides of the vines) and PRD (the application of water to one side of the vines only at any time). In the PRD treatment the frequency of alternating the 'wet' and 'dry' sides was determined according to soil moisture measurements and was typically every 5-7 days. It was very difficult to accurately schedule the irrigation at this site to avoid applying a moisture deficit to the PRD treatment. The shallow soil profile dried very quickly following irrigation and there were problems with the accuracy of the soil moisture sensing equipment for the duration of the experiment. As a result, PRD vines experienced repeated, excessive soil moisture deficits such that vine growth and production were significantly reduced each season. Shoot length was measured weekly during the growing season, while photosynthetically- active radiation (PAR), leaf area and canopy volume were measured at full canopy. Shoot number and pruning weight were measured during dormancy. All measures of vegetative growth (with the exception of PAR) were reduced in response to PRD. The decrease in lateral shoot growth for PRD resulted in greater bunch exposure and PAR. As a direct result of the severe soil moisture deficits experienced by the PRD treatment, all components of yield were significantly reduced compared to the control treatment each season. In particular, bunch weight and berry weight were significantly lower in the PRD treatment compared to the control, which suggests a period(s) of severe soil moisture deficit was experienced. Despite the yield loss sustained by the PRD treatment, WUE was improved compared to the control treatment in the first two years of this experiment. Berry anthocyanin levels were higher for the PRD treatment than the control but this may be due to the reduction in berry size. Weekly volumetric soil moisture monitoring showed that mounded soil was wetter than flat soil each year at similar horizons. In addition, the larger soil volume of the mounded treatment enhanced vine root development. Vegetative growth was greater in the mounded treatment than the flat treatment. Mounded vines grew more shoots than non-mounded vines, although there was no effect of mounding treatment on shoot length. The difference in shoot number was significant only in year 2, possibly due to the time required for vine roots to establish in the mounds. Pruning weight and mean shoot weight were higher for the mounded treatment each year and mounded vines grew more shoots than non-mounded vines in years 1 and 2. The increase in shoot weight of mounded vines, relative to non-mounded, was most likely due to the increase in lateral shoot growth which is supported by the lower PAR values of the mounded treatment compared to the flat treatment. Each year soil mounding resulted in higher vine yields than in flat soil beds as a direct result of the increased vine capacity of mounded vines. The mounded treatment had more shoots per vine than the non-mounded treatment and thus more bunches per vine. In addition, bunch weights were higher in the mounded treatment each year, due mainly to improved fruit set and more berries per bunch. Despite the mounded treatment resulting in a denser canopy than the non-mounded treatment this did not affect fruit composition in years 1 and 2. WUE was higher for the mound treatment in years 2 and 3 only, due to the volume of irrigation water applied being reduced, yet mounded vines continued to produce higher yields than non-mounded vines. In year 3, berries from vines grown in mounded soil had significantly higher pH than berries from vines grown in flat soil beds. Mounding treatment did not consistently affect berry anthocyanin or phenolic levels. Soil moisture levels were higher in the mulch treatment than the bare treatment in all seasons. In contrast to the mounding treatment, wetter soil did not consistently lead to improved vine growth or yield. Mulched vines developed fewer roots than non-mulched vines which is likely to have limited vine access to water and nutrients. As a result, shoot growth was similar for both treatments each season. The only significant difference between treatments for pruning weight was found in year 3 and was due entirely to shoot weight. The mulched treatment had lower PAR than the bare treatment in year 3, probably the result of increased lateral shoot growth and thus increased shoot weight, although this was not significant. PAR was significantly higher for the mulch treatment, compared to the bare treatment, in year 1 only but this was not supported by significant increases in vegetative growth. The mulch treatment resulted in higher vine yield than the non-mulch treatment in years 1 and 3. This difference was significant in year 3 only when both bunch number and bunch weight were significantly higher for mulched vines. In year 1 only bunch weight was significantly higher for mulched vines. Differences between treatments occurred in year 2 for fruit composition, specifically juice TA and anthocyanin levels. The mulch treatment had significantly higher TA and a significantly lower anthocyanin concentration in berries than the non-mulch treatment in year 2. There was no evidence of increased shading in the mulched treatment relative to the bare treatment that year but the difference in anthocyanin concentration may be explained by the significantly smaller berries of the bare treatment. Analysis of samples taken regularly from the soil profile and vine rootzone showed that there was no treatment effect on soil salinity but that soil ECse increased with soil depth and time each year. Petiole samples were collected at flowering, veraison and pre-harvest and levels were deemed toxic by pre-harvest each year. The PRD treatment received approximately 60{\%} of the salt applied to the control treatment. This did not reduce ECse but did result in lower measures of sodium and chloride in petioles and juice at harvest. Vines grown in soil mounds had access to a greater volume of soil water than the non-mounded vines. The mounded treatment had higher levels of pre-harvest petiole chloride in years 1 and 3 but this was significant only in year 3. There was no consistent trend in levels of sodium and chloride in the juice from either mound treatment, although in year 3 berry extract chloride levels were found to be significantly higher in the mounded treatment than the flat treatment. Similarly, a consistent trend in sodium and chloride levels of petioles and juice was not evident for the mulch treatment. Although, in year 3 petioles of vines grown in bare soil were found to contain significantly more petiole chloride than those which had straw mulch applied. The hypothesis that combining soil mounding, straw mulch and partial rootzone drying (PRD) irrigation will improve grapevine growth and production and reduce levels of sodium and chloride in the vine is rejected as there was not a consistent, cumulative effect of the three factors in this experiment.},

@article{Bertranou1983,
abstract = {The present paper briefly exposes several aspects related to water use, emphasizing the role of water discharge and re-use in agriculture. Mendoza is an Argentinian State located in a typical arid region. AS such, Mendoza has grown on the basis of intensive surface and ground water use, confronting today a clear overexploitation of the ground water reserves. This situation imposes a burden of increasing pumping costs and decreasing water quality for future generations. As it is well known, the common use of a natural resource (ground water reserves) is characterized by a time externality, which constitutes a market imperfection. In addition to this population growth, improvement in urban water provision and sewage services, increasing industrial water demand, etc., impose a host of problems in terms of water quantity and quality. In all these cases, it is commonly agreed, public action is required. It is our claim that most of the existing problems in relation to water use in Mendoza are common to most of the arid regions of the world. Hence, the present should constitute, at least partially, an adequate starting point for the establishment of rational guidelines in water management in arid zones. The second section of this paper contains a description of the nature of the regional water sources, centering attention on the water cycle in relation to agricultural use and its impact upon water quantity and quality. It also contains a brief description of the flood prevention system. The third section shows a characterization of the urban water provision and sewage system in the region, noticing the existing interrelationship between urban sewage and the irrigation system. A quantification of the volumes of water involved is provided. In the fourth section a similar description is made with regard to the industrial sector, where the amount of water used and an estimate of the industrial effluents organic load is advanced. A listing of social and economic impacts associated to water use and re-use in the region is presented in the fifth section, where the role and deficiencies of the present water management structure are set forth. Finally, the sixth section contains a set of recommendations aiming towards the establishment of a decision integrated management system.},

En Am{\'{e}}rica es declarada por Chile en abril de 2008, en octubre de 2009 por California. En Mendoza, en febrero de 2010, se evidencia su presencia. Es plaga cuarentenaria para Argentina. Se realizaron estudios de bioecolog{\'{i}}a y comportamiento en las condiciones agroecol{\'{o}}gicas de Mendoza como base para el logro de programas de manejo racionales de la plaga. Para la obtenci{\'{o}}n de la din{\'{a}}mica poblacional, se realiz{\'{o}} en forma semanal muestreos en vi{\~{n}}edos infestados de Lujan de Cuyo y Maip{\'{u}}. Para determinar el inicio de vuelos de machos de Lobesia botrana se colocaron trampas de feromonas. En la primera generaci{\'{o}}n, se monitorearon 100 inflores- cencias por semana. En las siguientes se hizo un muestreo dirigido, tomando s{\'{o}}lo racimos infestados. Las muestras, se llevaron a laboratorio donde bajo lupa binocular se determin{\'{o}} el estado que presentaba la plaga en ese momento. Las trampas se monitorearon dos veces por semana. Pasa el invierno como pupa protegida por un capullo bajo la ritidomis en la base del pit{\'{o}}n, brazos y parte superior del tronco. A inicios de setiembre se observaron los primeros vuelos de adultos. Las hembras colocaron huevos en forma aislada sobre las br{\'{a}}cteas florales de la inflorescencia, la corola y el pedicelo. Las larvas neonatas se alimentaron de los botones florales, introduci{\'{e}}ndose y consumiendo los estambres y el ovario. Mediante hilos sedosos unen los restos de flores formando los “glom{\'{e}}rulos”. Esta etapa dur{\'{o}} aproximadamente un mes, tras el cual se trasforma en cris{\'{a}}lida.

This property implies that changes in z affect the scale but not the shape of u(z, delta). This paper reviews the existing literature and identifies models that do and do not have the scaling property. It also discusses practical advantages of the scaling property.

While a variety of agri-environmental modelling tools exists, ex-ante policy assessment tools capturing the institutional dimension are rare and need to be improved. In this paper, we introduce a standardized procedure for ex-ante modelling institutional aspects for policy implementation: the ‘Procedure for Institutional Compatibility Assessment' (PICA). PICA has been designed as an explorative and flexible, yet formalized methodology that enables policy-makers to identify, at an early stage, potential institutional incompatibilities. After relating PICA to relevant approaches for policy assessment, we elaborate on its four distinct steps, use a core element of the EU Nitrate Directive to illustrate its function, and then provide model validation by means of a test case.},

This result is consequence of the fact thatas shown by Shephard the cost function and the input distance function (the reciprocal of Farrell's technical efficiency measure) are dual to each other. Similarly, the revenue function and the output distance function are dual providing the basis for the decomposition of revenue inefficiency into technical and allocative components (see for example, F{\"{a}}re, Grosskopf and Lovell (1994)). Here we extend those results to include the directional distance function and its dual, the profit function. This provides the basis for defining and decomposing profit efficiency. As we show, the output and input distance functions (reciprocals of Farrell efficiency measures) are special cases of the directional distance function. We also show how to use the directional distance function as a tool for measuring capacity utilization using DEA type techniques.},

abstract = {We consider a model that provides flexible parameterizations of the exogenous influences on inefficiency. In particular, we demonstrate the model's unique property of accommo- dating non-monotonic efficiency effect.With this non-monotonicity, production efficiency no longer increases or decreases monotonically with the exogenous influence; instead, the relationship can shifts within the sample. Our empirical example shows that variables can indeed have non-monotonic effects on efficiency. Furthermore, ignoring non-monotonicity is shown to yield an inferior estimation of the model, which sometimes results in opposite predictions concerning the data.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the efficiency with which water is used in small-scale irrigation schemes in North-West Province in South Africa and studies its determinants. In the study area, small-scale irrigation schemes play an important role in rural development, but the increasing pressure on water resources and the approaching introduction of water charges raise the concern for more efficient water use. With the data envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques used to compute farm-level technical efficiency measures and sub-vector efficiencies for water use, it was shown that under constant returns to scale (CRS) and variable returns to scale (VRS) specification, substantial technical inefficiencies, of 49{\%} and 16{\%}, respectively, exist among farmers. The sub-vector efficiencies for water proved to be even lower, indicating that if farmers became more efficient using the technology currently available, it would be possible to reallocate a fraction of the irrigation water to other water demands without threatening the role of small-scale irrigation. In a second step, Tobit regression techniques were used to examine the relationship between sub-vector efficiency for water and various farm or farmer characteristics. Farm size, landownership, fragmentation, the type of irrigation scheme, crop choice and the irrigation methods applied showed a significant impact on the sub-vector efficiency for water. Such information is valuable for extension services and policy makers since it can help to guide policies towards increased efficiency. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As part of the CRC 990: “Ecological and Socioeconomic Functions of Tropical Lowland Rainforest Transformation Systems (Sumatra, Indonesia)” of the University of G{\"{o}}ttingen, this thesis is devoted to the subject of the technical and environmental efficiency of smallholder palm oil and rubber production. With this research, we hope to find opportunities to reconcile economically beneficial small-scale palm oil and rubber cultivation in Indonesia with sustainability and diminished degradation of ecosystem services. The challenge to this problem is twofold. Firstly, the economic superiority of the two main crops rubber and oil palm over the traditional crops fostered the expansion of cultivation areas towards zones with the most biologically diverse systems on this planet, such as primary forest. The loss of biodiversity and ecosystems functions and degradation of soils con- tribute to overall concerns of both monoculture productions. Secondly, due to increasing cultivation of the two main crops, the cultivation systems themselves exploit the limited resources on which they ultimately depend. These factors further increase climate change, wherefore augmenting the productivity of the two production systems without increasing input allocations, contributes to the challenge. We identify these potentials via efficiency analysis. In three sections, this dissertation analyses the main transformation systems of oil palm and rubber to reveal the economic benefits, production determinants and the linked efficiencies of production. The analysis first focuses on the technical efficiency aimed at localizing sources of inefficiencies and possibilities to ameliorate the overall degree of efficient production by applying a stochastic frontier analysis. The latter showed that the historical development of the oil palm and rubber sector separated producers in autochthonous and transmigrated groups, leading to significant differences in their production techniques in the case of oil palm. Transmigrated producers, being the most efficient group, reflect the general tendency that security and support change the efficiency in both production systems. The second analysis enhances the estimation introducing an environmental dimension to the estimation of efficiency in smallholder rubber production. This interaction between rubber production and the status of the environment or the surrounding ecosystem underlies a trade-off function, the shape of which determines the interdependency. The empirical results show that this trade-off function is determined by an outward bending curve, indicating an increase in the desired output and following an increase in the disturbed ecosystem, represented by the number of invasive plants. Next to the general shape, we quantify the overall efficiency levels and specific determinants of an efficient production by analysing the trade-off curve. The third analysis focuses on the discussion of interdependence between oil palm and rubber production and environmental factors. For this purpose, we make use of a deterministic approach including a two-stage estimation of soil fertility parameters. The estimation revealed that the expansion of the cultivation area aggrandizes towards peat soil and that water-saturated mineral soils result in a higher inefficiency. Moreover, production efficiency is partly dependent on the soil parameters, indicating a possibility of alteration by fertilization.},

abstract = {The oasis irrigated by the Mendoza River (Province of Mendoza, Argentina) -like most cities at present- is facing problems such as urban encroachment into agricultural land, multiplicity of users, and reduced avai- lability of water resources, both in quantity and quality. Efforts and investments have been made to secure water availability (im- proved efficiencies, water saving); however, this is not the case as regards preservation of water quality. The agricultural sector in Mendoza has become the victim of pollution caused by urban and industrial development due to effluent discharges (point and/or diffuse) in the irrigation network. Studies conducted in Mendoza's Northern Oasis have shown high levels of phosphate po- llution in the Mendoza River. The objective of this paper is to study the spatio-temporal evolution as well as the sources of this type of pollution. The study, which was based on a number of samplings carried out from 2003 to 2009, points to moderate levels of phosphate pollution in the Northern Oasis irrigated by the Mendoza River. Considerably high phosphate levels were also detected at three specific sites in the oasis: 1. the area irrigated by the Cacique Guaymall{\'{e}}n and Jocol{\'{i}} canals (phosphate levels were six times the phosphate content in the water: from 0.2 mg L-1 at site R I to 1-2 mg L-1 at site C II); downstream of this latter site only a small area of 7300 ha is irrigated; 2. the area irrigated by the Pescara Canal downstream of site DVIII (1,250 ha), with mean content values seventeen times higher (8.5 mg L-1 ) than at site D I (0.49 mg L-1 ), where agricultural and stormwater runoff is discharged; 3. the Lower Mendoza River area, where phosphate con- tent increased sixteen times in the middle and tail-end sections of the system, with mean values ranging from 0.2 mg L-1 at site R II to 3.25 mg L-1 at R III.},

Elasticity estimates are drawn from 24 studies reported in the United States since 1963, including mathematical programming, field experiments, and econometric studies. The mean price elasticity is 0.48. Long-run elasticities, those that are most useful for policy purposes, are likely larger than the mean estimate. Empirical results suggest that estimates may be more elastic if they are derived from mathematical programming or econometric studies and calculated at a higher irrigation water price. Less elastic estimates are found to be derived from models based on field experiments and in the presence of high-valued crops.},

abstract = {The recent reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union extend in a significant way the “decoupling” process started some ten years earlier. By adopting the Single Farm Payment (SFP) scheme only limited support for agriculture is tied to current production decisions. This is also true of U.S. farm policy. The reform act of 1996 introduced greater planting flexibility, shifted some support to direct payments, and eliminated the authority for acreage reduction programs. The 2002 and 2008 Acts retained these features. However, they added countercyclical components to direct payments based on market prices and historic production, and allowed for updating of base acreage underlying direct payments. These steps arguably reintroduced ties between support and production decisions. This volume explores the economic implications of these recent changes in the design of agricultural policies for the economic performance of the sector in the European Union and the United States. The book is organized around five themes: (1) New Directions in Agricultural Policy: U.S. and EU Perspectives; (2) Agricultural Policy and Economic performance; (3) Energy and Agricultural Policy; (4) International Trade and Agricultural Policy; and (5) Commodity Programs and Risk Management. The authors apply rigorous tools to analyze the impact and implications of current agricultural policies on efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness in the sector, and consider opportunities for improvement in policymaking and practice.},

abstract = {In order to avoid the build-up of an excessive salinity by predicting in a specific system water-soil the changes in composi- tion of the soil solution after consecutive water replacement irrigations, the following empirical approach was proposed: 1) For each particular water-soil combi- nation a Functional Leaching Requirement (FLR) is defined as the inverse of the number of times, 1/n, that a certain Irrigation Quota (IQ)- or its equivalent as total amount of water per volume of soil- might be applied consecutively until leaching is required to limit the total soil salinity or any of its components; 2) The value of n is found experimentally by analyzing the saturation extract of a soil, whose initial conditions are known, after evaporating in a microwave oven increasing number of IQ of a certain irrigation water. This method was tried regionally in 40 combinations of 5 soils and 8 different waters and their FLR were compared with a theoretical expected leaching requirement (LR) calculated as the simple consequence of concentration, without any provision for changes in chemical composition during the process. The results show that in some water-soil combinations the FLR may differ significatively from the theoretical LR for total salinity (CEs) and the soluble boron content (Bs). A pot trial with grapevines in two different soils irrigated with the same water at two n values, and including a check irrigated only with demineralized water, validated the proposed method through the significant similarity found between the real final soil CEs and Bs and the predicted ones. Regressions were calculated among Bs, CEs, foliar boron (Bf), (Clf) and (Naf).},

@article{Piesse2018,
abstract = {Efficiency, partly based on technology, is central to international competitiveness. This article applies a stochastic frontier inefficiency model to a panel of 77 wine grape farms in South Africa between 2005 and 2015 and allows the comparison of efficiency levels for the old established wine regions with those of newer entrants. Thus, we investigate whether experience plus first choice of location matters more than the follower's advantage of newer technology. In all regions, a greater share of permanent labor and increased supervision raised efficiency, while more inorganic fertilizer and less irrigation has the opposite effect. Innovations in trellising had insignificant effects (except in the old regions) but not replacing old vines reduced efficiency. However, a higher proportion of red varietals also lowered efficiency in the old regions due to a fall in the price of red wine as these farmers continued to concentrate on quality reds. The new regions compensated for falling prices by increasing crop size with irrigation and fertilizer and extending the area planted, but with less concern for quality. This appears to be more successful in efficiency terms, but as international demand for quality wine increases it may be a poor long-term strategy.},

@article{Dai2018,
abstract = {Over the past decade, analyzing issues within the ‘water-energy nexus' has become a topic of increasing attention for the scientific and policy communities. Based on an extensive survey of recent scientific literature on the water-energy nexus, 70 studies were identified and 35 were selected as comprehensive case studies for review. The reviewed studies were classified and assessed according to groupings based on both geographic scale and their ‘nexus scope'. In addition to providing a depository summary of a wide range of current existing methods and tools for water-energy nexus analysis, the paper discusses these approaches based on their main purposes. From this review, it is clear that the research on water-energy nexus has seen a significant increase in both the number of studies and the capacity of the scientific community to productively assess water and energy interlinkages at a higher resolution. At the same time, this review has also concluded that, while many studies aim to develop new methods and frameworks to comprehensively assess interactions between water, energy and other elements, none can or do provide a singular framework for performing a “nexus study”. Furthermore, many researches are at the “understanding” stage with an emphasis on the quantitative analysis of the water-energy nexus. Fewer approaches are designed to support governance and implementation of technical solutions, and this is considered to a priority challenge area for the scientific community if it aims to achieve greater impact on resource policy and management. There is a clear need to improve our ability to classify and compare the capacities, strengths and weaknesses between existing approaches. This would better enable a wider group of stakeholders to utilize existing knowledge to improve their effective management of water and energy resources. It could also help focus the scientific community to more effectively improve upon the existing knowledge base and to increase focus on “governing” and “implementing” the nexus.},

abstract = {Undesirable outputs are often produced together with desirable outputs. This joint production of good and bad outputs is typically ignored in traditional measures of productivity since 'prices' are typically unavailable for bad outputs. Here we introduce a directional distance function and use it as a component in a new productivity index that readily models joint production of goods and bads, credits firms for reductions in bads and increases in goods, and does not require shadow prices of bad outputs. This index, as an empirical example shows, solves the problem caused by the joint production of good and bad outputs, and provides a practical managerial tool.},

@article{Abler1991,
abstract = {Growing evidence of surface-water and ground- water contamination has led to demands for federal and state water quality protection policies. Agriculture will be an important target of such policies. Numerous instances of surface-water and groundwater contamination by pesticides and fertilizers have been recorded, and one study estimates that the drinking water of 50 million people in the U.S. is potentially contaminated by agricultural chemicals (Hallberg, Nielsen and Lee). A number of policy approaches for reducing agricultural impacts on water quality are being discussed or implemented. These include extending the cross-compliance provisions of the 1985 and 1990 Farm Bills to include water quality protection, prohibitions on the use of certain chemicals (e.g., Proposition 128 in California), incentive payments for water quality protection schemes in the 1990 Farm Bill, and research and development on “low-input” production methods. In this paper we outline several of these approaches. We consider general approaches rather than specific proposals so that the outline is framed in broad terms. We also present economic and political criteria for evaluating the policy options and some tentative rankings.},

We find that (a) the actual increase in the volumes of water in terms of stream flows is much less than claimed by the Australian government; (b) subsidies to increase irrigation efficiency have reduced stream and groundwater return flows; (c) buy-backs are much more cost effective than subsidies; (d) many of the gains from water recovery have accrued as private benefits to irrigators; and (e) more than a decade after water recovery began, there is no observable basin-wide relationship between volumes of water recovered and flows at the mouth of the River Murray.},

abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive, updated picture of energy subsidies at the global and regional levels. It focuses on the broad notion of post-tax energy subsidies, which arise when consumer prices are below supply costs plus a tax to reflect environmental damage and an additional tax applied to all consumption goods to raise government revenues. Post-tax energy subsidies are dramatically higher than previously estimated and are projected to remain high. These subsidies primarily reflect underpricing from a domestic (rather than global) perspective, so that unilateral price reform is in countries' own interests. The potential fiscal, environmental, and welfare impacts of energy subsidy reform are substantial.},

(2008), Spiller and Tommasi (2007), and IDB (2005). First, the paper complements existing descriptions of the PMP by considering private agents and elaborating on structural characteristics possibly conducive to policymaking instability. Second, the paper illustrates the (negative) impact of Argentina's low- quality and myopic PMP equilibrium on productivity by examining two key areas: provision of infrastructure services and agricultural policy. Finally, the paper explores the PMP at the local level of government (municipalities and local communities), finding that it mimics the flaws observed at the federal level.},

Study focus The purpose of this paper is to review and analyze the water, energy, and food nexus and regions of study, nexus keywords and stakeholders in order to understand the current state of nexus research. New hydrological insights Through selected 37 projects, four types of nexus research were identified including water–food, water–energy–food, water–energy, and climate related. Among them, six projects (16{\%}) had a close linkage with water–food, 11 (30{\%}) with water–energy–food, 12 (32{\%}) with water–energy, and eight (22{\%}) with climate. The regions were divided into Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America, South America, Middle East and Africa. North America and Oceania had a tendency to focus on a specific nexus type, water–energy (46{\%}) and climate (43{\%}), while Africa had less focus on water–energy (7{\%}). Regarding keywords, out of 37 nexus projects, 16 projects listed keywords in their articles. There were 84 keywords in total, which were categorized by the author team depending on its relevance to water, food, energy, climate, and combination of water–food–energy–climate, and 40 out of 84 keywords were linked with water and only 4 were linked with climate. As for stakeholders, 77 out of 137 organizations were related to research and only two organizations had a role in media.},

abstract = {At the outset of the twenty-first century, Argentine wines have begun to command serious attention worldwide from the experts as well as from the wine-consuming public. The fact that Argentina is capable of producing superb wines should come as no surprise. Its diverse Andean wine regions have almost ideal conditions for production—excellent soils, a dry climate with substantial variations between daytime and nighttime temperatures and near absolute control over water. What is surprising is Argentina's long-term hesitance to produce the quality wines it is clearly capable of. Whether in the early stages of the industry's growth at the end of the nineteenth century or one hundred years later, quality wine production was hardly the norm: only in the 1990s did Argentine wines begin to realize their enormous potential.},

abstract = {Climate change in many local and regional scales is expected to include climate hazards and extreme conditions including hailstorms, droughts, floods, hurricanes, hail, tornadoes and storms. Droughts are serious climate hazards threatening water supply for human consumption and also agricultural production and are anticipated to increase in intensity and duration in both Mendoza, Argentina and southern Alberta, Canada. Both Mendoza and Alberta have irrigated agriculture and their rivers are fed primarily by snowmelt and rainfall runoff from mountainous headwaters. Many similarities exist between water law and governance in the Mendoza river basin, Argentina and the Oldman river basin in southern Alberta, Canada. However, many differences also exist. Can these governance systems ensure the continuation of agricultural production in the area into the future given increased development and climate change? Utilizing the institutional design principles of adaptive capacity and water governance, this paper will compare and contrast the water governance institutional structures in the two study areas. Data was obtained from two multi-disciplinary studies of institutional adaptation to climate change studying vulnerability of local agricultural producers and communities to climate change, and the interplay of water governance structures, and adaptive capacities. The water governance systems of both countries show concerns relating to gaps in information and equitable outcomes; in addition there are concerns of a lack of capacity to enable reflexivity. Both systems have been responsive (although there is room for improvement). Through strengthening these identified weaknesses these systems can continue to be resilient into the future.},

abstract = {Chile has become an increasingly important player in international wine markets. Concurrent with the expansion of Chilean wine output and exports, there has been an increase in production in several other “New World” countries including Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The overall growth in wine supplies has increased competition to capture market share, which highlights the importance of productivity gains among wine and grape producers. The purpose of this paper is to estimate and analyze the technical efficiency (TE) component of productivity for a sample of wine grape producers in Chile. The data includes 38 farms with specific input-output information for individual blocks yielding a total of 263 observations. We use a Cobb-Douglas model to estimate a stochastic production frontier (SPF) and to obtain TE scores both at the individual block and at the farm level. The results suggest that the average farm level TE is 77.2{\%}, while the block level TE ranges from 23.4 to 95.0{\%}. The value of the function coefficient is 1.021, which suggests nearly constant returns to size.},

abstract = {The US and Germany are compared on their energy use and water use, the factors that influence them and the resulting efficiency. Water abundance and an energy-focused political atmosphere makes energy a top priority for the water sector in Germany. Water stress, leaky pipe infrastructure and comparatively fledgling energy policy make energy a low priority among US water/wastewater utilities (WWUs). Although developed by a US-led team in 2011, the ISO 50001 energy management standard has as of 2016 been adopted and certified by more than 9000 German companies, including 200 WWUs, compared to 47 companies in the US, including one single WWU. While adoption of ISO 50001 may continue growing at a rate similar to past management standards ISO 9001 and 14001, experience in Germany and elsewhere shows that it might be more effectively used in the US as a policy mechanism in conjunction with financial incentives. A water savings of 81{\%} would be required to reach German levels by reducing water losses (23{\%} thereof) and water use (77{\%}). The consequent embedded energy savings (virtually contained in the water savings) is 39{\%} of the maximum possible energy savings in the water sector. The remaining 61{\%} comes from long-term technical improvements, assuming a savings quota of 30{\%}. For the entire water sector in the US, this means a maximum energy savings of nearly 50{\%} (34.2 TWh). Achieving even a fraction of this optimistic estimate would lead to substantial savings.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The recognition of the interlinked nature of water, energy and food (WEF) resources has resulted in growing momentum to change the approaches for managing these interlinked resources. Initially, models were developed as a mean of integrated methodology for watershed management. Several frameworks and models have been proposed to help policymakers understand the complexity of the nexus and to assist with planning and regulating these resources. Most countries and governments manage these natural resources with different institutions that have their own mission and objectives, and with their own staff, data, measures and tools. This has mostly led to huge variations in terms of methodological approach to design these models, type of data used and eventually results interpretations and policies design. We conducted a review of current literature on the water-energy-food nexus to understand what's known and what's missing and identify key opportunities and challenges facing WEF design and modeling. Our analysis also identified the followings:•Our review reveals that there is a limited number of models and frameworks that address all WEF together and there is even less number of models and frameworks that has diverse methods and transdisciplinary approaches in analyzing the nexus. It's essential as we design out modeling tools to analyze the nexus to incorporate several dimensions beyond the WEF sectors such as political, social and economic in order to reach nexus thinking and therefore address complexity of the multi-sectoral resources.•Agricultural sectors require significant amounts of energy as an input to production, yet few water-energy-food resource planning approaches have incorporated spatial cropping patterns and land use by combining energy and water requirements.•Policymakers are provided with an effective way to analyze the nexus on an aggregate level using macro-drivers, but these often omit the complexity of managing the resources at a smaller scale where other factors such as climate and geography have tremendous influence on supply and demand.•There are knowledge gaps pertaining the incorporation of spatial-temporal drivers as well as the spatial-temporal dynamics of resource availability or accessibility. This is a significant component in the WEF framework design as natural resources are subject to dramatic changes over space and time.•There are considerable number of WEF framework and models that demonstrate promising tools to analyze the nexus but some of these models fall short of capturing interactions among nexus components due to lack of data sharing and availability.The increased regional and global variation in natural resources distribution over time and space creates a need to develop more sophisticated models that incorporate these drivers to support the planning and regulatory policy process. These models should also be flexible enough to be applied at varying geographic levels to support resource management at the national, regional, watershed and project levels. Integrating spatial-temporal drivers would result in more comprehensive models that can deliver better policies for sustainable development, increase synergies between institutions and improve social welfare.},

abstract = {The effects of climatic factors on yield and berry and wine quality for long-term (7 years) deficit-irrigated (DI) Monastrell wine grapes under the semiarid conditions of southeast Spain were analyzed. The relationships between climatic variables and the yield, and novel technological berry quality (QItechnologicalberry), phenolic berry quality (QIphenolicberry), overall berry quality (QIoverallberry), and wine quality (QIwine) indices confirmed that the most important climatic factors were rainfall, temperature, and radiation. Climate was more influential in determining yield, berry, and wine composition in some important physiological periods such as early season (budburst–fruit set) and ripening (v{\'{e}}raison–harvest). In general, climate had more influence on berry quality than on wine quality indices and greater QIoverallberry was also reflected in greater QIwine. According to the stepwise multiple regression, the best fitted models for the partial root-zone drying irrigation (PRI) system were less complex (with a lower number of climatic variables) than for the regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) system, suggesting that PRI is less influenced by climatic factors than RDI. For PRI, the models for yield, berry and wine quality were explained by three climatic factors (rainfall, T{\textordfeminine}, and radiation), whereas for RDI, more climatic factors came into play (number of hours of sunshine, evapotranspiration, and vapor pressure deficit). According to these models, in RDI, a sunny and drier pre-v{\'{e}}raison period followed by higher soil water availability and associated greater crop evapotranspiration during ripening favored final berry and wine quality. In contrast, in PRI, greater rainfall during the growing season and greater solar radiation during ripening were the main climatic factors that positively influenced the yield response, berry and wine quality. Besides, berry quality in PRI was more affected (negatively) by high temperatures (high T{\textordfeminine}max and T{\textordfeminine}min) during the growing season than in RDI and SDI, indicating that cooler and humid years may favor the PRI response more. These results suggest that years with a cool, wet winter followed by a mild, wet spring and early summer (April–June) and a mild fruit set–v{\'{e}}raison period (June–July), and then greater solar radiation during ripening (August–mid-September) provide adequate growth potential and increase the likelihood of higher berry and wine quality in PRI. Besides, more irrigated SDI vines were less sensitive to high temperatures and low soil water content during ripening than RDI and PRI vines.},

abstract = {Profitability change can be decomposed into the product of a total factor productivity (TFP) index and an index measuring changes in relative prices. Many TFP indexes can be further decomposed into measures of technical change, technical efficiency change, scale efficiency change and mix efficiency change. The class of indexes that can be decomposed in this way includes the Fisher, T{\"{o}}rnqvist and Hicks–Moorsteen TFP indexes but not the Malmquist TFP index of Caves, Christensen and Diewert (1982). This paper develops data envelopment analysis methodology for computing and decomposing the Hicks–Moorsteen index. The empirical feasibility of the methodology is demonstrated using country-level agricultural data covering the period 1970–2001. The paper explains why relatively small countries tend to be the most productive, and why favourable movements in relative prices tend to simultaneously increase net returns and decrease productivity. Australia appears to have experienced this relative price effect since at least 1970. Thus, if Australia is a price-taker in output and input markets, Australian agricultural policy-makers should not be overly concerned about the estimated 15 per cent decline in agricultural productivity that has taken place over the last three decades.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to evaluate the economic efficiency of irrigated agricultural enterprises using a non-radial data envelopment analysis approach. While a number of studies have used radial measures based on data envelopment analysis to obtain efficiency scores for a given production technology, we calculate non-radial measures to understand the efficiency of using individual inputs employed in the production process. In particular, the measures of economic efficiency are decomposed into water use efficiency and managerial efficiency. This decomposition enables us to obtain an efficiency score for the use of water as an environmentally sensitive input in irrigated crop production systems. Treating water input in this way goes beyond traditional measurement of water use efficiency, as the calculated efficiency scores can be used as indicators of sustainability in terms of water withdrawals for irrigation purposes. The results show that the overall efficiency for the considered irrigated enterprises is quite high. This is in contrast to the findings on the water use efficiency scores, which are fairly low. This indicates that while Australian irrigated farms are comparatively more efficient in overall farm activity management, they are not very efficient in managing water resources. In turn, this threatens the sustainability of this industry. There is a substantial variation of water use efficiency scores across irrigated enterprises and across regions. Analysing these variations can provide important insights for current policy and for future efforts to improve water use efficiency that will lead towards more sustainable irrigation industry},

These two approaches make different assumptions when modeling the joint production of good and bad outputs. The environmental production function credits a producer solely for expanding good output production, while the directional environmental distance function credits a producer for simultaneously increasing production of the good output and reducing production of bad outputs. Estimates of technical efficiency and pollution abatement costs are calculated using data from coal-fired power plants. These results provide the empirical basis for comparing the environmental production function to the environmental directional distance function.},

abstract = {Irrigation water reallocations are playing an increasingly important role in both developed and developing countries. With growing urban and environmental water demands, rising costs for the development of new water supplies, and irrigated agriculture usually including the least economically valuable use of water, transfers of irrigation water to alternative uses are increasing. However, such reallocations are often controversial, and it is often questioned whether the benefits resulting from these transactions are large enough to outweigh the associated costs. This paper reviews the experience with irrigation water transfers, including the involvement of the World Bank. It discusses the problems of assessing the direct economic effects of reallocations, with a focus on the foregone direct benefits in irrigated agriculture. Because foregone direct benefits cannot easily be directly observed, they need to be estimated. However, assessments have shown widely differing estimates—even when the same methodology was used. The paper reviews the methodologies and model specifications used for estimating foregone direct benefits; illustrates the impact of different model specifications on the magnitude of estimates of foregone direct benefits based on an application in an example case; and draws conclusions with regard to future efforts in assessing reallocation effects, including calculating adequate compensation for farmers. Because estimating the direct benefits of irrigation expansion is methodologically equivalent to estimating foregone direct benefits from reduced irrigation water supplies, the findings have implications for a broader range of water allocation decisions.},

abstract = {Agriculture's water quality and quantity challenges continue to grow in many regions of the world. Policy solutions have been identified, but not always applied where needed nor implemented effectively. This report analyses eight past water and agriculture policy changes in OECD countries with the aim to identify steps towards adopting and implementing such solutions effectively. Selected reforms are assessed systematically via an institutional change analysis and a cross-cutting comparison of political economy factors. A characterisation of reforms is proposed according to the scope of the reform process, the scope of the reform's action, and the involvement of governments in the design of reforms and their implementation. The comparison of agriculture and water policy changes shows that introducing reforms can be facilitated by exogenous factors, including droughts and floods, and reform design features. Meanwhile, the outcome of reforms can be affected by their geographical scale and scope, the dynamic pattern of reform pathways, and compensation for farmers. There are, however, trade- offs between the effects of these factors on the reform's ambition, effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility.},

abstract = {Climate change and recurrent drought in many of the world's dry places continue to inspire the search for economically attractive measures to conserve water. This study analyzes water conservation practices in irrigated agriculture in a sub-basin in North America's Rio Grande. A method is developed to estimate water savings in irrigated agriculture that result from public subsidies to farmers who convert from surface to drip irrigation. The method accounts for economic incentives affecting farmers' choices on irrigation technology, crop mix, water application, and water depletion. Findings show that farmers will invest in technologies that reduce water applications when faced with lower financial costs for converting to drip irrigation. Subsidies for drip irrigation increase farm income, raise the value of food production, and reduce the amount of water applied to crops. However, an unexpected result is that water conservation subsidies that promote conversion to drip irrigation can increase the demand for water depleted by crops. Our findings show that where water rights exist, water rights administrators will need to guard against increased depletion of the water source in the face of growing subsidies for drip irrigation. Our approach for analyzing water conservation programmes can be applied where water is scarce, irrigation is significant, food security is important, and water conservation policies are under debate.

abstract = {This paper presents an integrated hydrologic-economic modeling framework for optimizing conjunctive use of surface and groundwater at the river basin scale. Integrated river basin modeling with distributed groundwater simulation and dynamic stream-aquifer interaction allows a more realistic representation of conjunctive use and the associated economic results. The use of an economic objective function, maximizing the net economic value of water use, provides solutions that optimize economic efficiency in water resources management. Constraints guarantee the feasibility and sustainability of suggested operations. A nonlinear optimization model is presented for the Adra River Basin system (Spain). Model results suggest a variety of water management and operation strategies and indicate where significant the economic benefits can be obtained through capacity expansion. A procedure allowing a systematic assessment of the economic indicators required by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is provided. The shadow values of water balance constraints provide time series of marginal economic value of water at different locations, from which indicators of the WFD's “resource cost” can be derived. The opportunity cost of satisfying minimum ecological streamflow, reservoir storage, or piezometric head constraints to achieve the required “good water status” can be assessed by the corresponding shadow values.},

abstract = {This study analyzes the performance of Latin America and the Caribbean's agriculture between 1980 and 2012 looking at the contribution of inputs, and total factor productivity (TFP) to growth in output per worker. A growth-accounting approach that goes along the lines of neoclassical growth accounting combined with Data Envelopment Analysis, allows us to measure TFP growth using output and input indices and also to decompose this growth into contributions of technical change and changes in technical efficiency. Our findings show that between 1980 and 2012, regional agricultural output per worker and TFP increased 82 and 45 percent, respectively, reducing the difference between TFP in LAC and in OECD countries. This improved performance of agriculture was the result of fast growth in the use of fertilizer, increases in land productivity, and growth in the use of capital that expanded cultivated area per worker. Higher productivity of the animal stock, fast growth in the use of feed and in the number of animals per worker, have increased the share of livestock in total output and also contributed significantly to the improved performance of agriculture. Observed growth patterns at the country level suggest that countries that increased input per worker have increased TFP at a higher rate than countries with limited access to capital and land. As a result of these growth patterns, the improved performance in the region has amplified differences in labor productivity between countries. Growing differences in labor productivity and the fact that the favorable shock in commodity prices that benefited LAC's agriculture in recent years has apparently ran its course, raise concerns for the future.

Our model can accommodate both technical and (input) allocative inefficiencies among firms. We also present the algorithm for quantifying the cost of allocative inefficiency. We showcase our cost-system-based model by applying it to study the production of Norwegian dairy farms during the 1991-2008 period. Among other things, we find both an economically and statistically significant improvement in the levels of technical efficiency among dairy farms associated with the 1997 quota scheme change, which a more conventional single-equation stochastic frontier model appears to be unable to detect.},

@article{Scheierling2016,
abstract = {Expectations are that the agricultural sector will have to expand the use of water for irrigation to meet rising food demand, while at the same time the competition for water resources is growing in many regions. Increasing water productivity in agriculture is widely seen as a critical response to help address this challenge. Yet much of the public debate is vague on the meaning of agricultural water productivity — often emphasizing “more crop per drop” as if water were the only input that mattered —, and approaches for assessing and increasing water productivity are seldom addressed systematically. This paper discusses conceptual issues that should be kept in mind when assessing agricultural water productivity, and presents findings from what may be the first survey of the agricultural productivity and efficiency literature with regard to the explicit inclusion of water aspects in productivity and efficiency measurements. The survey comprises studies applying single-factor productivity (SFP) measures, total factor productivity (TFP) indices and frontier models. Studies using deductive methods are also included. A key finding is that the studies tend to either incorporate field- and basin-level aspects but focus only on a single input (water), or they apply multi-factor approaches but do not tackle the basin-level aspects. It seems that no study has yet presented an approach that accounts for multiple inputs and basin-level issues. Deductive methods may provide the flexibility to overcome some of the limitations of the other methods.},

En zonas {\'{a}}ridas como Mendoza, el consumo y la eficiencia en el uso del agua requieren de especial atenci{\'{o}}n en todos los sectores de la demanda: dom{\'{e}}stico, riego, industrial y ambiental. Los establecimientos industriales de la provincia utilizan fundamentalmente agua subterr{\'{a}}nea, ya sea para refrigerar, como insumo para el producto o para la limpieza en distintas partes del proceso productivo; en este {\'{u}}ltimo caso, con retorno al sistema h{\'{i}}drico. El conocimiento del volumen de agua que utilizan estas industrias es importante para diversas aplicaciones, tales como el c{\'{a}}lculo del agua virtual de los productos, como tambi{\'{e}}n para la realizaci{\'{o}}n de balances h{\'{i}}dricos que incorporan los usos sectoriales a nivel de cuenca. Para conocer el consumo de agua por parte de la industria alimenticia de Mendoza, se propone utilizar coeficientes que relacionen volumen de agua con los insumos del proceso industrial, tales como materia prima procesada, mano de obra utilizada, producto elaborado. Estos coeficientes pueden ser aplicados para realizar las estimaciones a nivel de cuenca, del volumen de agua utilizada por estas industrias. El presente trabajo propone valores de coeficientes de uso industrial del agua para algunas ramas de actividad de las agroindustrias de Mendoza. Los coeficientes primarios se obtuvieron a partir de entrevistas presenciales en establecimientos industriales con diferentes escala de producci{\'{o}}n, tales como: bodegas, conserveras de frutas y hortalizas, cerveceras, bebidas no alcoh{\'{o}}licas y empacadoras de fruta. Los informantes fueron gerentes y/o t{\'{e}}cnicos de dichos establecimientos a quienes se les consult{\'{o}} sobre el agua consumida, la materia prima procesada y el producto elaborado.

abstract = {This paper extends previous work focusing on the analysis of technical efficiency (TE) for a sample of Chilean wine grape producers. We apply alternative panel data models to a cross-sectional dataset that contains multi-block observations for individual farms. The results show that when the individual blocks are treated as independent from each other, the average estimated TE scores are lower than those estimated when it is recognized that blocks belonging to a particular farm are subject to an overall central (farm-level) management and that individual blocks have a separate specific performance. This points to the importance of accounting for unobserved heterogeneity when repeated observations from individual farms are available on a cross-section. Regional location was also found to matter for grape production. Moreover, agro-climatic conditions were found to be influential on production levels where grape farms located on cooler zones produce significantly less than their counterparts in warmer zones. Overall, our estimations show the importance of accounting for both farm heterogeneity and agro-climatic conditions when analyzing TE in grape production.},

abstract = {This paper explores current and future issues of water availability and use in one of the world's major wine-producing areas, Mendoza Province in Argentina. The region is located close to the Central Andes and is characterized by an arid to semi-arid climate, which exacerbates pressures on land-use and water resources for wine production. The principal supply of water originates in the snow and ice fields of the nearby Andean peaks. Already under stress today, the environmental, economic and societal structure of the region, highly dependent on the wine industry, is likely to be vulnerable to climate change in the course of the 21st century. In this study, the possible impacts of shifting temperature and precipitation patterns and climate variability linked to extreme events and El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation ENSO on water resources in the region and consequently on the wine industry will be investigated. While climatic factors already today exert a major control on water availability, water use is also shown to be influenced by non-climatic factors, in particular overexploitation of the resource and a certain degree of opacity of policies related to water rights and water allocation. Climate model results for the future suggest that there may be important changes in the quantity and timing of stream flow, highly dependent on the Andean cryosphere where many glaciers are already rapidly shrinking today. The direct impacts of a changing climate on wineries include extreme events and also decreased water availability for irrigation in the long term. In view of the importance wine as a major income-earner for Argentina, public water policies will need to address both the issues of unreliable current water governance practices and the adaptations necessary to cope with a changing climate.},

This paper reviews the literature, linking water savings with water diversion and water depletion, both from theoretical models and empirical evidence from the published research. In order to increase knowledge of this phenomenon, a new empirical case study is presented based on a survey of 36,000 ha of recently modernized irrigated areas in the Guadalquivir basin (southern Spain). The results of the case study illustrates the conditions that may avoid rebound effect, although the results of the available empirical evidence and the published theoretical research are diverse and lead to contradictory results. Further research is therefore needed to determine the causes and solutions of water saving investment impacts and the possible speculative rebound effect.},

@article{Meinzen-Dick2014,
abstract = {While the role of secure property rights contributing to sustainable natural resource management is increasingly recognized, translating that into practice is more challenging, especially in developing countries. This article presents a framework for understanding the role of property rights for effective irrigation systems and then explores the complexity of property rights to land, water, and infrastructure and their underlying institutions. Understanding property rights in practice requires acknowledging legal pluralism—the coexistence of many types and sources of law, which can be used as the basis for claiming rights over the resources. Property rights do not necessarily imply full ownership, but are composed of different bundles of rights that may be held by different claimants—the state, user groups, families, or individuals. These rights are critical for the authority, incentives, and resources for irrigation operation and maintenance. As resources become more scarce, property rights systems need to adapt to reduce conflict and provide incentives for saving water. However, efforts to improve irrigation by changing property rights systems have often failed because they have not recognized the difficulty of transplanting property rights systems from one place to another. Institutional change needs to be seen as an organic process, building on existing norms and practices, rather than as an exercise in social engineering.},

abstract = {Sourcing grapes from independent growers for use in top quality wines sold on the international market is a major organisational challenge for corporate wineries. Our paper adds to the small collection of existing literature addressing these coordination issues in the New World wine sector, by going deeper into the specifics of the contracts. Based on a case-study carried out in the Argentine province of Mendoza, this article presents an in-depth analysis of the technical process, in order to identify the contractual hazards posed by asset specificity, measurement costs, and non-contractible actions. Expanding Transaction Cost Economics to include contract completion and plural governance literature, this paper analyses the contractual and non-contractual mechanisms (price incentives, grower monitoring, allocation of decision rights to the winery, role of backward integration) used to govern such grape transactions. Through our analysis, we were able to arrive at four main conclusions. Firstly, most agreements are still verbal, with the exception of occasional written contracts, whose scope only encompasses minor legal points. It became clear to us that formal, rigid agreements are not always adequate in managing the inherently complex interactions between grape varieties, soil, farming practices and winemaking processes in high-end wine production. Secondly, extensive decision rights are allocated to wineries, to deal with incompleteness. These are key decisions to be taken during the cropping and harvesting process. Thirdly, pricing is generally kept flexible, with grape prices negotiated ex-post. This means that trade imbalances tend to be resolved in the long term. Winegrowers also benefit from financial rewards to compensate for the allocation of authority. Finally, any potential opportunistic behaviour by wineries with regard to asset specificity (in particular yield limitation) and allocation of rights is kept at bay by mechanisms such as winery reputations and credit third-party guarantee. This type of opportunistic behaviour by growers is similarly deterred through monitoring and vineyard ownership on the part of the wineries.},

@article{Anderson2009,
abstract = {During the 1960s and 1970s most developing countries imposed anti-agricultural policies, while many high-income countries restricted agricultural imports and subsidized their farmers. Both sets of policies inhibited economic growth and poverty alleviation in developing countries, while doing little to assist small farmers in high-income countries. Since the 1980s, however, many developing countries began to reduce the anti-agricultural bias of sectoral policies, and from the early 1990s the European Union began to move away from price supports to more-direct forms of farm income payments. This paper summarizes a forthcoming book that seeks to explain this evolving pattern of distortions to incentives conceptually and econometrically by making use of new political economy theory and a new globally comprehensive and consistent set of estimates of the changing extent of annual distortions over the past half-century. The distortion estimates involve more than 70 products that cover around 70 percent of the value of agricultural output in each of 75 countries that together account for over 90 percent of the global economy, and they expose the contribution of the various policy instruments (both farm and non-farm) to the net distortion to farmer incentives. Such a widespread coverage of countries, products, years and policy instruments has allowed this collection of studies to test a wide range of hypotheses suggested by the new political economy literature, including the importance of institutions. As a set it sheds much new light on the underlying forces that have affected incentives facing farmers in the course of national and global economic and political development, and hence on how those distortions might change in the future or be changed by concerted actions to offset political pressures from traditionally powerful vested interests.},

abstract = {Globally, groundwater use is intensifying to meet demands for irrigation, urban supply, industrialization, and, in some instances, electrical power generation. In response to hydroclimatic variability, surface water is being substituted with groundwater, which must be viewed as a strategic resource for climate adaptation. In this sense, the supply of electricity for pumping is an adaptation policy tool. Additionally, planning for climate-change mitigation must consider CO2 emissions resulting from pumping. This paper examines the influence of electricity supply and pricing on groundwater irrigation and resulting emissions, with specific reference to Mexico—a climate–water–energy ‘perfect storm'. Night-time power supply at tariffs below the already-subsidized rates for agricultural groundwater use has caused Mexican farmers to increase pumping, reversing important water and electricity conservation gains achieved. Indiscriminate groundwater pumping, including for virtual water exports of agricultural produce, threatens the long-term sustainability of aquifers, non-agricultural water uses, and stream–aquifer interactions that sustain riparian ecosystems. Emissions resulting from agricultural groundwater pumping in Mexico are estimated to be 3.6{\%} of total national emissions and are equivalent to emissions from transporting the same agricultural produce to market. The paper concludes with an assessment of energy, water, and climate trends coupled with policy futures to address these challenges. Keywords:},

abstract = {In this letter, we investigate the effects of crop yield and livestock feed efficiency scenarios on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture and land use change in developing countries. We analyze mitigation associated with different productivity pathways using the global partial equilibrium model GLOBIOM. Our results confirm that yield increase could mitigate some agriculture-related emissions growth over the next decades. Closing yield gaps by 50{\%} for crops and 25{\%} for livestock by 2050 would decrease agriculture and land use change emissions by 8{\%} overall, and by 12{\%} per calorie produced. However, the outcome is sensitive to the technological path and which factor benefits from productivity gains: sustainable land intensification would increase GHG savings by one-third when compared with a fertilizer intensive pathway. Reaching higher yield through total factor productivity gains would be more efficient on the food supply side but halve emissions savings due to a strong rebound effect on the demand side. Improvement in the crop or livestock sector would have different implications: crop yield increase would bring the largest food provision benefits, whereas livestock productivity gains would allow the greatest reductions in GHG emission. Combining productivity increases in the two sectors appears to be the most efficient way to exploit mitigation and food security co-benefits.},

abstract = {Mendoza Province is the major Argentinian vitivinicultural region, and its grape production is fundamental for the national vintage. The 1979–2009 climate–annual grape yield relationships are analyzed, and total grape yield is shown to depend significantly on regional “summer” (October–March) precipitation. Precipitation negatively affects yields through plant disease and damage/destruction by hail. At interannual scales, summer regional precipitation variability can explains 25{\%} of the yield variance. Summer precipitation modulates yield with a 6–8-yr period: wet (dry) summers can be associated with larger (smaller) grape damage/loss probability during the summer preceding the vintage, as well as lower (higher) grape yields in the subsequent annual campaign because of bud damage. With respect to monthly mean precipitation at Mendoza Observatory, wetter Novembers/Decembers can lead to lower yields. Hail during the summer of the previous harvest and during December could lower yields. Winter, late spring, and early summer mean maximum temperatures can impact current and subsequent annual yields: warmer (colder) months are linked to enhanced (decreased) yields. These relationships can be associated with circulation and SST conditions in the equatorial and extratropical Pacific Ocean basin and southern South America: SSTs within the southeastern South Pacific are related to western equatorial Pacific SSTs and convection, which modify circulation and water vapor transport over southern South America. Statistical multilinear modeling shows that the observed relationships among yield, precipitation, and temperature can explain at least 60{\%} of the observed interannual yield variability. It is thus possible to quantitatively estimate, some months in advance, the upcoming vintage's yield.},

Several policy alternatives are currently being considered in order to improve the efficiency of irrigation water use so that extraction of groundwater is diminished. An understanding and quantification of different sources of inefficiency in groundwater extraction is critical for policy design. Survey data from a geographically extensive sample of irrigators is used to gauge the importance of common pool problems on input-specific irrigation inefficiency. Results show that mechanisms of electricity cost sharing implemented in many wells have a sizable impact on inefficiency of irrigation application. Moreover, irrigation is very inelastic to its own unitary cost. Therefore, results suggest that policies aimed at eliminating electricity cost-sharing mechanisms would be significantly more effective than electricity price-based policies in reducing irrigation application. Results also show that well sharing does not affect groundwater pumping significantly, suggesting either a limited effect of individual pumping on water level or absence of strategic pumping by farmers sharing the wells.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider an environmental production process in which firms intend to produce outputs (which we label as desirable/good) but the production process is such that it automatically produces some other unintentional but inevitable undesirable (bad) outputs as by-products (emission of pollutants). Like stochastic production frontier, by-production technology specifies that there is a minimal amount of the by-product that is produced, given the quantities of inputs and desirable outputs. The presence of (environmental) inefficiency in by-production therefore means that more than this minimal amount of the undesirable output is produced. Similarly, the presence of technical inefficiency implies that, given inputs, less than the maximal possible amount of desirable outputs is produced. Alternatively, it means that more than the minimal amounts of inputs are used to produce a given level of desirable output. We use the "by-production technology" approach which is a composition of production technology of desirable outputs and the technology of by-products, and estimate both technical and environmental efficiency. Given that electricity, the good output in our application, is demand determined, we treat it as exogenous and address the endogeneity of inputs by using the first-order conditions of cost minimization. Some of our models automatically take endogeneity of bad outputs into account. We use an efficient Bayesian MCMC technique to estimate both good and bad output technologies and both types of inefficiency. We also compare results with some alternative models with and without endogeneity corrections.},

abstract = {An analysis of the efficiency of wine and grapevine producers in Italy was performed. Data for 2005 and 2010 from the Farm Accountancy Data Network were used; this network records the balance sheets of a representative sample of farms. The data were analyzed using data envelopment analysis, which is a method for estimating the comparative efficiency of a group of farms. We investigated the determinants of the estimated levels of efficiency through an econometric model, aiming to understand which farm and area characteristics affect the differences in efficiency levels. The results indicate that between 2005 and 2010, a reduction in grape prices led to an increase in the efficiency of companies producing wine compared with a significant reduction among companies that are dedicated exclusively to the production of grapes.},

@article{DelaHera2007,
abstract = {We investigated the effects of partial root-zone drying (PRD) applied at different periods on leaf water relations, vegetative development, fruit yield, must and wine quality in wine grapes (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Monastrell) during a 3-year field experiment in order to determine the importance of the timing of PRD application on physiological and agronomical vine response under semiarid conditions. Two irrigation treatments were applied: conventional drip irrigation (CI) and PRD. Both treatments received the same annual water quantity. Each year the PRD treatment was applied at different periods of the growth cycle. In 1999 PRD was applied from veraison to harvest (end July–early September); in 2000 from fruit set to harvest (mid June–early September); and in 2001 PRD from budburst to harvest (mid April–early September). Leaf water relations and gas exchange during the experimental period were not significantly affected by PRD treatment. In 1999 and 2000 there was no significant treatment effect on vegetative development, yield or fruit quality. However, in 2001 (when PRD was applied from budburst to harvest), reproductive and vegetative development was clearly altered in PRD vines. Fruit set percentage and vegetative development (shoot length, pruning weight and primary and lateral leaf area) were significantly increased in PRD vines compared to CI. This resulted in both higher yield (kg per vine) (43{\%}) and water use efficiency (40{\%}) compared to CI vines. Berry number per cluster and cluster weight were also significantly increased in PRD vines. Notwithstanding higher yield in PRD vines and a similar berry size, the must and wine quality was not significantly altered, indicating a higher synthesis and accumulation of photoassimilates and metabolites in the berries of PRD vines. We conclude that there was an positive effect on vegetative and reproductive growth when long-term PRD was applied from the beginning of growing season (budburst), suggesting that early onset of PRD is desirable to intensify PRD response under these semiarid conditions. Nevertheless from these results we need to further investigate the long- and short-term effects of PRD, with moderate water amounts, on vegetative and reproductive development such as flowering and fruit set processes in wine grapes.},

abstract = {Through a comparative, longitudinal analysis of the wine industry in two Argentine provinces, this article examines how different political approaches to reform shape the ability of societies to build new institutions for economic upgrading. The article finds that inherited structural factors per se can not easily explain the different solutions to this challenge. A better explanation focuses on how governments confront the dual challenge of redefining the boundary between the public and private domains and of recombining the socio-economic ties among relevant firms and their respective business associations. A "depoliticization" approach emphasizes the imposition of arm's-length incentives by a powerful, insulated government, but appears to contribute little to institutional change and upgrading. A "participatory restructuring" approach promotes the creation of public-private institutions via adherence to two key principles: a) inclusion of a wide variety of relevant stakeholder groups and b) rules of deliberative governance that promote collective problem-solving. This latter approach appears to have the advantage of facilitating collaboration and knowledge creation among previously antagonistic groups, including government},

@article{Atkinson2016,
abstract = {A substantial literature has dealt with the problem of estimating multiple-input and multiple-output production functions, where inputs and outputs can be good and bad. Numerous studies can be found in the areas of productivity analysis, industrial organization, labor economics, and health economics. While many papers have estimated the more restrictive output- and input-oriented distance functions, here we estimate a more general directional distance function. A seminal paper on directional distance functions by Chambers (1998) as well as papers by F{\"{a}}re et al. (1997), Chambers et al. (1998), F{\"{a}}re and Grosskopf (2000), Grosskopf (2003), F{\"{a}}re et al. (2005), and Hudgins and Primont (2007) do not address the issue of how to choose an optimal direction set. Typically the direction is arbitrarily selected to be 1 for good outputs and -1 for inputs and bad outputs. By estimating the directional distance function together with the first-order conditions for cost minimization and profit maximization using Bayesian methods, we are able to estimate optimal firm-specific directions for each input and output which are consistent with allocative and technical efficiency. We apply these methods to an electric-utility panel data set, which contains firm-specific prices and quantities of good inputs and outputs as well as the quantities of bad inputs and outputs. Estimated firm-specific directions for each input and output are quite different from those normally assumed in the literature. The computed firm-specific technical efficiency, technical change, and productivity change based on estimated optimal directions are substantially higher than those calculated using fixed directions.},

Most of the studies contributing to this preception have been flawed by methodological shortcomings and the request is that these studies be treated with caution. Using recent farm survey data from the wine producing areas of the Western Cape of South Africa, this study attempts to overcome some of the methodological problems, distinguishing between partial and total productivity measures. Using data envelopment analysis, most of the wine grape producers were found to operate under constant returns to scale. Co-operative membership seemed to overcome the economies of scale associated with processing and marketing. The inverse relationship between farm size and both land productivity and total factor productivity is weak, not consistently negative and differs between regions. Thus, caution must be used when advocating rural development policies based on the inevitability of an inverse relationship existing in all sectors and production regions of agriculture.},

abstract = {Multi-input multi-output production technolo- gies can be represented using distance functions. Econo- metric estimation of these functions typically involves factoring out one of the outputs or inputs and estimating the resulting equation using maximum likelihood methods. A problem with this approach is that the outputs or inputs that are not factored out may be correlated with the composite error term. Fernandez et al. (J Econ 98:47–79, 2000) show how to solve this so-called ‘endogeneity problem' using Bayesian methods. In this paper I use the approach to estimate an output distance function and an associated index of total factor productivity (TFP) change. The TFP index is a new index that satisfies most, if not all, eco- nomically-relevant axioms from index number theory. It can also be exhaustively decomposed into a measure of technical change and various measures of efficiency change. I illustrate the methodology using state-level data on U.S. agricultural input and output quantities (no prices are needed). Results are summarized in terms of the characteristics (e.g., means) of estimated probability den- sity functions for measures of TFP change, technical change and efficiency change. Keywords},

abstract = {With growing water scarcity and increasing competition across water-using sectors, the need for water savings and more efficient water use has increased in importance in water resources management. Improvement in the physical efficiency of water use is related to water conservation through increasing the fraction of water beneficially used over water applied, while enhancing economic efficiency is a broader concept, seeking the highest economic value of water use through both physical and managerial measures. Physical and economic efficiency measures are both useful indicators for water management at the irrigation system and river basin level. However, the relationship between physical efficiency and economic efficiency is not always clear, and the values of these measures may indicate different directions for water policy and investments in irrigation. Open research questions include, for example, the following: How does the change in responsiveness of water allocation and irrigation technology to economic incentives affect physical and economic irrigation efficiency? What is the impact of a change in irrigation system efficiency on basin physical and economic efficiency? How do changes in water withdrawals affect basin physical and economic efficiency under a given water requirement? To explore these issues, an integrated economic-hydrologic river basin model is applied to the Maipo River Basin in Chile. A series of modeling scenarios is defined, and policy implications based on changes in physical and economic efficiencies for basin-wide irrigation water management are analyzed.},

abstract = {Using an environmentally adjusted performance measurement the study evaluates the tradeoffs between the benefits derived from irrigated cotton enterprises and its associated environmental damages. Deep drainage, which adds to the aquifer recharge and thereby contributes to salinization, is treated as an environmentally detrimental output. The analysis includes data collected from a sample of 53 observations in the Mooki Catchment located in northern New South Wales, Australia. Environmentally adjusted efficiency of cotton enterprises is estimated using the environmental performance index (EPI) and relative efficiency rankings are determined for each of the considered cotton areas in the catchment. The findings reveal that environmentally adjusted efficiency of irrigated cotton is within an acceptable range (more than 60{\%} of observations have an EPI efficiency score of greater than 5). The efficiency variation among the observations based on hydrological response units (HRUs) can be attributed to a number of reasons including physical factors (i.e., soil quality, topography), type of irrigation technology used, and other environmental factors. For instance, the overall efficiencies of downstream HRUs are higher than that of upstream HRUs. Therefore, biophysical characteristics of an area need to be incorporated in the efficiency model. With the identification of the most and least efficient cotton irrigation areas in the region, policymakers can construct a relative ranking to best determine policy directions in order to take a more targeted approach towards salinity mitigation.

The true IDF is approximated by a flexible translog functional form estimated using a full information maximum likelihood method. Technical and environmental efficiencies are disaggregated across farms and account for spatial variations. Our results show that there is a significant correlation between the two efficiencies. The IDF is used to compute the cumulative Malmquist productivity index and the Fisher index. The two indices are used to measure changes in technology, profitability, efficiency and productivity in response to the adoption of two selected Best Management Practices (BMPs) whose objective is to reduce water pollution. We found significant differences across BMPs regarding the direction and the magnitude of their effect.},

In the water deficit treatment, irrigation was applied when midday stem water potential (SWP) dropped below −2.5 MPa; SWP of controls was maintained between −1.2 and −1.5 MPa. Across irrigation treatments, oil yield at high density (968 kg ha−1) was 70 {\%} higher than at low density. Reduction in oil yield due to deficit irrigation was not significant compared to control (501 vs. 664 kg ha−1). IWUE at lower tree density averaged 1.5 kg ha−1 mm−1, increased by 50 {\%} in intermediate density and by 57 {\%} at the highest density. Deficit irrigation increased IWUE twofold with respect to controls. IWUE responded to the interaction density × irrigation whereby the highest IWUE (4.6 kg ha−1 mm−1) was obtained at highest density and deficit irrigation. IWUE was nonlinearly related to seasonal water stress integral ((Formula presented.)), where maximum efficiency corresponded to 180 MPa days. The negative correlation between fruit water concentration and (Formula presented.) highlights the potential benefit of deficit irrigation of increasing oil extractability. The positive outcomes of increasing the density (higher oil yield) and deficit irrigation (higher IWUE, lower water concentration in fruit) need to be weighed against the long-term effect on vegetative growth. Under our conditions, three seasons of water deficit reduced crown and trunk size by 35 {\%} in relation to fully irrigated.},

The methodology comprises two versions of the input-output price model: an average cost formulation and a mark-up formulation. The input-output framework evaluates the impact of the various water policy measures on production prices, consumption prices, intermediate water use and private real income. The results show that a tax on the water used by sectors considerably reduces intermediate water consumption and increases production and consumption prices. On the other hand, according to Jevons' paradox, improvements in technical efficiency, which lead to a reduction in the water requirements of all sectors and an increase in water production, raise water consumption. The combination of a tax on the water used by sectors and an improvement in the technical efficiency of water in the production sphere takes the pressure off prices and significantly reduces intermediate water consumption. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {By ignoring the opportunity cost of water use, water is undervalued, which can lead to significant errors in investments and water allocation decisions. The marginal resource opportunity cost (MROC) varies in time and space, as resource availability, demands, and users' WTP vary. This spatial and temporal variability can only be captured by basinwide hydro-economic models integrating water demands and environmental requirements, resources, infrastructure, and operational and institutional restrictions. This paper presents a method for the simulation of water pricing policies linked to water availability, and the design of efficient pricing policies that incorporate the basinwide marginal value of water. Two approaches were applied: priority-based simulation and economic optimization. The improvement in economic efficiency was assessed by comparing the results from simulation of the current system operation and the pricing schedule. The difference between the benefits for the simulated current management and the upper bound benefits from optimization indicates the maximum gap that could be bridged with pricing. In the application to a synthetic case, a storage-dependent step pricing schedule derived from average MROC values led to benefits that capture 80{\%} of the gap of net benefits between management without pricing and the economically optimal man- agement. Different pricing policies were tested, depending not only on reservoir storage but also on previous inflows. The results show that the method is useful for designing pricing policies that enhance the economic benefits, leading to more efficient resource allocations over time and across the competing uses},

We also describe what has been learned so far about possible adaptation strategies for grape growers that would allow them to mitigate the economic effects of climate change. We conclude that climate change is likely to produce winners and losers, with the winners being those closer to the North and South Poles.

@article{Wang2010,
abstract = {Abstract Irrigation water shortage is becoming an increasingly serious problem in agricultural production. In this case, it is very important for policy makers to take measures to improve irrigation water use efficiency, especially in the water-scarce areas. In this paper, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques, based on the concept of input-specific technical efficiency were used to develop farm-level technical efficiency measures and sub-vector efficiencies for irrigation water use. The Tobit regression technique was then adopted to identify the factors that influence irrigation water efficiency differentials under the shortage of water resources. Based on a sample data of 432 wheat farmers in northwestern China, our experimental results of the DEA analysis showed the average technical efficiency of 0.6151. It suggested that wheat farmers could increase their production by as much as 38.49{\%} by using inputs more efficiently. Further, the mean irrigation water efficiency of 0.3065, suggested that wheat farmers could produce the same quantity of wheat using the same quantity of inputs but with 69.35{\%} less water. The results of the Tobit regression analysis showed that the farmer's age, income, education level, and the farm size tended to affect the degree of irrigation water efficiency positively, and the channel conditions and different irrigation methods made a significant impact on irrigation water use efficiency. Furthermore, the arrangements of exclusive water property rights and competitive water price mechanism have effectively encouraged the water saving behavior of farmers. These results are valuable for policy makers since it could help to guide policies towards high irrigation water use efficiency. Key},

abstract = {Rising energy prices will alter water allocation and distribution. Water extraction and conveyance will become more costly and demand for hydroelectric power will grow. The higher cost of energy will substantially increase the cost of groundwater, whereas increasing demand for hydroelectric power may reduce the price and increase supply of surface water. High energy prices and geopolitical considerations drive investment in land-and water-intensive biofuel technology, diverting land and water supplies to energy production at the expense of food production. Thus, rising energy prices will alter the allocation of water, increase the price of food and may have negative distributional effects. The impact of rising energy prices and the introduction of biofuels can be partly offset by the development and adoption of new technologies, including biotechnology. The models considered here can be used to determine the effects of rising energy prices on inputs, outputs, allocation decisions and impact on distribution},

abstract = {Incorporating an ecological variable for the productive capacity of the grassland into the production function is a new step toward conducting technical efficiency analysis for livestock grazing. This variable is generated using remotely sensed net primary productivity (NPP) data and available grassland area, and entitled as grassland total NPP capacity. With the one-step approach of using a multi-output, multi-input stochastic input-oriented distance function based on field survey data combined with NPP data, we estimated the technical efficiency of livestock grazing on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau using two measurements related to ecological performance, an environmental performance indicator and environmental efficiency. The average technical efficiency is estimated to be 0.837 when considering grassland total NPP capacity, implying that livestock grazing inputs can be decreased by 16.3{\%} without any reduction in outputs. The average environmental performance indicator is estimated to be 0.013, representing the effects in association with NPP per unit grassland. Environmental efficiency is about 0.123, meaning there might be overuse of grassland total NPP capacity in livestock grazing, in terms of overuse of grassland size or overuse of NPP per unit grassland. Understanding relationship between technical efficiency and ecological performance would be helpful for balancing local economic development and environmental protection.},

abstract = {Knowledge about productivity and efficiency differences between conventional and organic farms has important implications for the evaluation of the economic viability of these two agricultural practices. The main purpose of this study was to compare the efficiency ratings of organic and conventional grape farms in Catalonia. To do so, we fit a stochastic production frontier to cross sectional, farm-level data collected from a sample of 141 Catalan farms that specialize in grape growing. Results show that organic farmers, on average, are more efficient than their conventional counterparts (efficiency ratings are on the order of 0.80 and 0.64, respectively). Apart from adoption of organic practices, experience is also found to improve technical efficiency. Conversely, technical efficiency tends to decrease with the relevance of unpaid family labor, farm location in less favored areas, and farmers' strong environmental preservation preferences.},

abstract = {Stochastic frontier models are typically estimated by maximum likelihood (MLE) or corrected ordinary least squares. The consistency of either estimator depends on exogeneity of the explanatory variables (inputs, in the production frontier setting). We will investigate the case that one or more of the inputs is endogenous, in the simultaneous equation sense of endogeneity. That is, we worry that there is correlation between the inputs and statistical noise or inefficiency. In a standard regression setting, simultaneity is handled by a number of procedures that are numerically or asymptotically equivalent. These include 2SLS; using the residual from the reduced form equations for the endogenous variables as a control function; and MLE of the system that contains the equation of interest plus the unrestricted reduced form equations for the endogenous variables (LIML). We will consider modifications of these standard procedures for the stochastic frontier setting. The paper is mostly a survey and combination of existing results from the stochastic frontier literature and the classic simultaneous equations literature, but it also contains some new results.},

Res. 142 (2002) 16] propose using data translation as a means of integrating undesirable outputs and inputs into data envelopment analysis (DEA) models. By 'reversing' the bad outputs, they can be readily included in the standard DEA output increasing model, and the usual scaling will actually reduce the bad outputs. This recognizes the fact that increases in those outputs and inputs are not desirable, yet does not resort to the usual ad hoc treatment of undesirable outputs as inputs. Here we suggest an alternative approach which allows us to explicitly model a joint environmental technology and gauge performance in terms of increased good output and decreased undesirable output. This is achieved by adopting a directional distance function which may be estimated using the usual linear programming techniques employed in DEA. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper aims at assessing performan- ce of drip irrigation in irrigated areas of the Mendoza and Tunuy{\'{a}}n river basins in the Pro- vince of Mendoza, Argentina. Assessments in 17 properties made it possible to determine uniformity coefficients, irrigation water salinity and soil salinity at the head, center and tail of the irrigation unit, in the wet bulb and in the spacing between laterals in two layers of the soil profile (0.10-0.30 m and 0.30-0.50 m). Soil texture and its possible relation with sali- nity levels measured in the rhizosphere were also determined. The uniformity coefficient in 18{\%} of the irrigation subunits was below the recommended range and significant differen- ces were observed in 94{\%} of the properties between mean flows in irrigation subunits and operational sectors. When soil extracted from the bulb was compared with soil extracted from the spacing between laterals, significant differences were found in salinity of the soil saturation extract, in sodium content and in chloride anion content. No differences in the above variables were found at different soil depths. Increase in salinity levels was due to: sampling location (bulb or spacing between laterals), irrigation water quality, and soil texture. Variations in sodium content, on the other hand, depended on sampling location (bulb or spacing between laterals) and bicar- bonate content in the soil. Results show that routine assessments of uniformity of irrigation systems and irrigation-induced-salinization should be carried out.},

The results show that: (1) water use efficiency is higher in economically developed provinces such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. (2) In general, inefficiencies of labor input and water input are larger than that of capital input. (3) After taking into account sewage as unexpected output, inefficiency of gross domestic product (GDP) for each province is quite low, but most provinces have inefficient sewage emission. (4) It is found in the analysis of influencing factors that the ratio of added value of agricultural sector, water usage per capita and sewage per unit of output have negative impact on water resources use efficiency, while the import dependence and export dependence have positive impact.

The objective of this paper is to identify the source of nitrate contamination in aquifers. Several physical-chemical and biological parameters were analyzed to assess groundwater quality, and isotope techniques were used to trace the origin of groundwater and the source of nitrates. Results show that nitrate contamination in semi-confined and confined aquifers does not originate in the overlying unconfined aquifer, which is affected by reuse of industrial effluents, but is caused by the horizontal groundwater flow from the greater Mendoza area contaminated by sewer leakage and on-site sanitation systems.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes a new database that sheds light on the impact of trade-related policy developments over the past half century on distortions to agricultural incentives and thus also to consumer prices for food in 75 countries spanning the per capita income spectrum. Price-support policies of advanced economies hurt not only domestic consumers and exporters of other products but also foreign producers and traders of farm products, and they reduce national and global economic welfare. On the other hand, the governments of many developing countries have directly taxed their farmers over the past half-century, both directly (e.g., export taxes) and also indirectly via overvaluing their currency and restricting imports of manufactures. Thus the price incentives facing farmers in many developing countries have been depressed by both own-country and other countries{\^{A}}' agricultural price and international trade policies. We summarize these and realted stylized facts that can be drawn from a new World Bank database that is worthy of the attention of political economy theorists, historians and econometricians. These indicators can be helpful in addressing such questions as the following: Where is there still a policy bias against agricultural production? To what extent has there been overshooting in the sense that some developing-country food producers are now being protected from import competition along the lines of the examples of earlier-industrializing Europe and Japan? What are the political economy forces behind the more-successful reformers, and how do they compare with those in less-successful countries where major distortions in agricultural incentives remain? And what explains the pattern of distortions across not only countries but also industries and in the choice of support or tax instruments within the agricultural sector of each country?},

@book{Easter2014,
abstract = {A growing demand for water combined with the impact of climate change on the timing and quantity of water availability have dramatically changed how policy makers view water resources. Pressure is building on water managers to do a better job of conserving and allocating water resources. Adding to this is the demand for more water to meet environmental needs, which makes it even more imperative that we substantially improve our water use. One mechanism for doing this is the increased use of water markets. One of the objectives of this book is to provide the reader with a clear picture of what we have learned about water markets. Since we completed our first water markets book in the 1990s (Easter, Rosegrant, and Dinar, 1998, Markets for Water: Potential and Performance) a lot has happened around the world which has improved our understanding of the possible problems and opportunities for the future use of water markets. The book is a combination of results from new research and surveys of water markets in key parts of the world.Water markets in countries across five continents are examined.Australia has discovered the problem of sleeper water rights and has begun to use the water market to buy water for environmental flows.We have also become aware of local water markets that have been operating in Oman for centuries. These and many other experiences need to be spelled out in one place to help guide our future use and development of water markets. The second objective of the book is to assess where we are with water markets andwhat suggestionswe can make for their use in the twenty-first century to help us adapt to the impact of climate change and population growth on the availability of water resources. It is clear that with climate changewaterwill need to be reallocated and used more effectively. We need to use less water and stop polluting it. The big question for us is how water markets can better help us address these tasks. Changes in water institutions will be a key part of the process as will the allocation of water rights or water use rights. Some of the biggest new insights come from the experience Australia has had with water markets over the last two decades in which they made major changes in their water institutions. Other countries such as Chile, Spain, and the USA havemademodest changes, butmore are needed. Yet countries such as South Africa may eliminate the use of water markets because politicians have raised concerns regarding the equity of the current ownership of water rights. Many seem to forget that water markets are just a tool to help manage and allocate water. The actual ownership and allocation of water rights or use rights is a separate issue. Water markets do not determine the initial allocation of rights. Markets can come into play once thewater rights or use rights have been established. Sincewater rights are generally quite valuable their distribution can be highly political. The findings in this book suggest that a holistic approach should be taken to consider the physical environmental as well as institutions and politics in developing effective water markets.},

@article{Latruffe2016,
abstract = {The objective of this article is to examine the association between agricultural subsidies and dairy farm technical efficiency in the European Union, and in so doing we make novel contributions to the literature. We include in the analysis nine diverse western European Union (EU) countries over an 18-year period (1990–2007) encompassing the various Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms enacted since the inception of the EU. Further, we account for input endogeneity using an original method of moments estimator. Our results show that the effect of subsidies on technical efficiency may be positive, null, or negative, depending on the country. The analysis reveals that the introduction of decoupling with the 2003 CAP reform weakens the effect that subsidies have on technical efficiency. },

@article{Booker2012,
abstract = {Over the last 25 years, economic water policy models have evolved in concept, theoretical and technical methods, scope and application to address a host of water demand, supply, and management policy questions. There have been a number of theoretical and empirical advances over this period, particularly related to estimation of nonmarket, public good water-related values involving different methods of valuation. We discuss modeling advances including modeling multiple, competing demands, types of incentives and technologies and behavioral responses, incorporation of groundwater and other supply alternatives, integration of institutional factors, and increasing attention to system-wide impacts. The largest changes in hydroeconomic policy models have been the integration of the individual demand and supply components, inclusion of environmental values, incorporation of governance and institutional conditions (laws, regulations and policies), and expansion to river basin and even interposing scales of analysis. Important areas of future hydroeconomic model advances will be the use of genetic and neurological based algorithms for solving dynamic, stochastic problems, reconstruction of hydrological and economic relationships for remotely sensed data, and the expansion of models to understand and address transboundary water resource economic, hydrologic, environmental and institutional policy, and interdependencies},
