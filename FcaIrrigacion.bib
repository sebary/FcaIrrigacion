This article analyzes the performance of economic instruments in water allocation reforms compared against their original design objectives in five European countries: England, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. We identify the strengths of, barriers to and unintended consequences of economic instruments in the varying socio-economic, legal, institutional and biophysical context in each case study area, and use this evidence to draw out underlying common guidelines and recommendations. These lessons will help improve the effectiveness of future reforms while supporting more efficient water resources allocation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual framework for both assessing the role of economic instruments, and reshaping them in order to enhance their contribution to the goals of managing water scarcity. Water management problems stem from the mismatch between a multitude of individual decisions, on the one hand, and the current and projected status of water resources on the other. Economics can provide valuable incentives that drive individual decisions, and can design efficient instruments to address water governance problems in a context of conflicting interests and relevant transaction costs. Yet, instruments such as water pricing or trading are mostly based on general principles of welfare economics that are not readily applicable to assets as complex as water. A flaw in welfare economic approaches lies in the presumption that economic instruments may be good or bad on their own (e.g., finding the “right” price). This vision changes radically when we focus on the problem, instead of the instrument. In this paper, we examine how economic instruments to achieve welfare-enhancing water resource outcomes can realize their full potential in basin-scale management contexts. We follow a political economy perspective that views conflicts between public and private interest as the main instrumental challenge of water management. Our analysis allows us to better understand the critical importance of economic instruments for reconciling individual actions towards collective ambitions of water efficiency, equity and sustainability with lessons for later-adopting jurisdictions. Rather than providing panaceas, the successful design and implementation of economic instruments as key river basin management arrangements involves high transaction costs, wide institutional changes and collective action at different levels.},

Employing a primary data set on grapevine production combined with energy consumption and irrigation data, this paper analyzes the environmental efficiency of grapevine producers at the plot level. Distance functions are the selected parametric technique. High-quality grapevine represents good output, and the excess of water the bad output. Excess water is measured based on applied water volume, crop requirements, soil characteristics and management practices. The model is augmented with the introduction of a spatial weighting matrix on the right-hand side. Our preliminary results point that different water sources and irrigation systems have an effect on the technical and environmental performance of the vineyards, which could be clustered through the spatial peculiarities of the territory.},

abstract = {This report offers a guide on potential reform pathways towards sustainable agriculture water use, based on a thorough review of selected past water and agriculture reforms and extensive consultation with policy experts. A theory of change is developed that emphasises the importance of flexibility in the timing and design of reform processes to achieve practical and effective policy changes. Governments should prepare future reforms, via continued research, education, and governance efforts, to help take advantage of reform opportunities when the timing is right. Five necessary conditions are identified for a successful reform process: (i) support evidence-based problem definition, objective setting and evaluations; (ii) ensure that governance and institutions are aligned with the policy change; (iii) engage stakeholders strategically and build trust; (iv) rebalance economic incentives to mitigate short run economic losses; and (v) define an adjustable smart reform sequencing that provides flexibility in the long run. These conditions are found to be necessary to implement four challenging policy changes: charging water use in agriculture; removing subsidies that negatively impact water resources, regulating groundwater use and addressing nonpoint source pollution. But the relative effort that governments need to devote to fulfilling each of the five conditions will vary depending on the policy change. Keywords:},

abstract = {As the Argentinean grapevine production systems have gained global visibility, the wine industry has been revitalized with a greater focus on enological quality, technology adoption, and export orientation. Although grapevine production has decreased 36{\%} in a decade nationwide, the province of Mendoza accounts for 66{\%} of grapevine production and 73.3{\%} of the wine making. These changes are explained by relatively more technologically advanced production systems with a focus on quality and a higher decrease of vine hectarage in other provinces of Argentina. Small and medium size producers face scale limitations, financial constraints, and uneven access to quality irrigation water. There is a concern that vineyards fall short on their potential and that they are not optimizing their resources. The contribution of this dissertation is to unveil the underlying political and economic factors that affect the performance of vineyards and their effects on water resources. This dissertation departs from previous empirical applications by shedding light on the efficiency determinants of grapevine production and simultaneously accounting for agroecosystem characteristics and plot level information including irrigated water volumes in Mendoza, Argentina. Technical and environmental efficiency is assessed utilizing an unique dataset of 647 plots that includes, soil characterization, water volumes, and dummy variables for technology adoption and enological practices. The research considers that farmers jointly produce a desired output (grapevines) and an undesired output (saline hazard), both are dependent on the farmers' location as well as their production systems and practices. The framework allows for estimation of the directional distance function following the most fair direction; that is, increasing grapevine production while decreasing salinity hazard. Results of the estimation confirm an existing trade-off relationship between grapevine production and saline hazard. The mean economic environmental efficiency is 0.869 corresponding a mean inefficiency of 0.131.},

@article{Bertranou1983,
abstract = {The present paper briefly exposes several aspects related to water use, emphasizing the role of water discharge and re-use in agriculture. Mendoza is an Argentinian State located in a typical arid region. AS such, Mendoza has grown on the basis of intensive surface and ground water use, confronting today a clear overexploitation of the ground water reserves. This situation imposes a burden of increasing pumping costs and decreasing water quality for future generations. As it is well known, the common use of a natural resource (ground water reserves) is characterized by a time externality, which constitutes a market imperfection. In addition to this population growth, improvement in urban water provision and sewage services, increasing industrial water demand, etc., impose a host of problems in terms of water quantity and quality. In all these cases, it is commonly agreed, public action is required. It is our claim that most of the existing problems in relation to water use in Mendoza are common to most of the arid regions of the world. Hence, the present should constitute, at least partially, an adequate starting point for the establishment of rational guidelines in water management in arid zones. The second section of this paper contains a description of the nature of the regional water sources, centering attention on the water cycle in relation to agricultural use and its impact upon water quantity and quality. It also contains a brief description of the flood prevention system. The third section shows a characterization of the urban water provision and sewage system in the region, noticing the existing interrelationship between urban sewage and the irrigation system. A quantification of the volumes of water involved is provided. In the fourth section a similar description is made with regard to the industrial sector, where the amount of water used and an estimate of the industrial effluents organic load is advanced. A listing of social and economic impacts associated to water use and re-use in the region is presented in the fifth section, where the role and deficiencies of the present water management structure are set forth. Finally, the sixth section contains a set of recommendations aiming towards the establishment of a decision integrated management system.},

This paper reviews the literature, linking water savings with water diversion and water depletion, both from theoretical models and empirical evidence from the published research. In order to increase knowledge of this phenomenon, a new empirical case study is presented based on a survey of 36,000 ha of recently modernized irrigated areas in the Guadalquivir basin (southern Spain). The results of the case study illustrates the conditions that may avoid rebound effect, although the results of the available empirical evidence and the published theoretical research are diverse and lead to contradictory results. Further research is therefore needed to determine the causes and solutions of water saving investment impacts and the possible speculative rebound effect.},

Policy solutions have been identified, but not always applied where needed nor implemented effectively. This report analyses eight past water and agriculture policy changes in OECD countries with the aim to identify steps towards adopting and implementing such solutions effectively. Selected reforms are assessed systematically via an institutional change analysis and a cross-cutting comparison of political economy factors. A characterisation of reforms is proposed according to the scope of the reform process, the scope of the reform's action, and the involvement of governments in the design of reforms and their implementation. The comparison of agriculture and water policy changes shows that introducing reforms can be facilitated by exogenous factors, including droughts and floods, and reform design features. Meanwhile, the outcome of reforms can be affected by their geographical scale and scope, the dynamic pattern of reform pathways, and compensation for farmers. There are, however, trade-offs between the effects of these factors on the reform's ambition, effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility.},

abstract = {Energy and water are interlinked. The development, use, and waste generated by demand for both resources drive global change. Managing them in tandem offers potential for global-change adaptation but presents institutional challenges. This paper advances understanding of the water-energy nexus by demonstrating how these resources are coupled at multiple scales, and by uncovering institutional opportunities and impediments to joint decision-making. Three water-energy nexus cases in the United States are examined: (1) water and energy development in the water-scarce Southwest; (2) conflicts between coal development, environmental quality, and social impacts in the East; and (3) tensions between environmental quality and economic development of shale natural gas in the Northeast and Central U.S. These cases are related to Eastern, Central, and Western regional stakeholder priorities collected in a national effort to assess energy-water scenarios. We find that localized challenges are diminished when considered from broader perspectives, while regionally important challenges are not prioritized locally. The transportability of electricity, and to some extent raw coal and gas, makes energy more suitable than water to regionalized global-change adaptation, because many of the impacts to water availability and quality remain localized. We conclude by highlighting the need for improved coordination between water and energy policy. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In decision-making processes, reliability and risk aversion play a decisive role. This paper presents a framework for stochastic optimization of control strategies for groundwater nitrate pollution from agriculture under hydraulic conductivity uncertainty. The main goal is to analyze the influence of uncertainty in the physical parameters of a heterogeneous groundwater diffuse pollution problem on the results of management strategies, and to introduce methods that integrate uncertainty and reliability in order to obtain strategies of spatial allocation of fertilizer use in agriculture. A hydro-economic modeling approach is used for obtaining the allocation of fertilizer reduction that complies with the maximum permissible concentration in groundwater while minimizes agricultural income losses. The model is based upon nonlinear programming and groundwater flow and mass transport numerical simulation, condensed on a pollutant concentration response matrix. The effects of the hydraulic conductivity uncertainty on the allocation of nitrogen reduction among agriculture pollution sources are analyzed using four formulations: Monte Carlo simulation with pre-assumed parameter field, Monte Carlo optimization, stacking management, and mixed-integer stochastic model with predefined reliability. The formulations were tested in an illustrative example for 100 hydraulic conductivity realizations with different variance. The results show a high probability of not meeting the groundwater quality standards when deriving a policy from just a deterministic analysis. To increase the reliability several realizations can be optimized at the same time. By using a mixed-integer stochastic formulation, the desired reliability level of the strategy can be fixed in advance. The approach allows deriving the trade-offs between the reliability of meeting the standard and the net benefits from agricultural production. In a risk-averse decision making, not only the reliability of meeting the standards counts, but also the probability distribution of the maximum pollutant concentrations. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the influence of the variance of the hydraulic conductivity fields on the strategies. The results show that the larger the variance, the greater the range of maximum nitrate concentrations and the worst case (or maximum value) that could be reached for the same level of reliability. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper reviews integrative modelling approaches which were developed to analyze the impact of multifunctional agriculture, or which may be used as such. The approaches are integrative in combining multiple goals of agriculture, and confronting these with current or potential performance of agricultural land-use systems at different spatial scales. The paper focuses on France, Germany and The Netherlands, countries with a track record in quantitative systems modelling, to identify convergence of concepts and technologies applicable to assessment of multifunctional agriculture and to establish shortcomings through analysis and comparison of 15 integrative modelling cases. An analytical framework for comparison is applied, based on a conceptual model of goal-oriented evaluation of agriculture. Results demonstrate unexpectedly large differences between countries in the number of integrative models; the nature of agro-ecological or bio-economic relations used, and target audience. Common elements were a focus on methodology development rather than answering questions of specific clients, limited attention for model evaluation and impact analysis, and an imbalanced attention for economic and abiotic environmental indicators at the expense of biotic, landscape and social indicators. None of the approaches specifically addressed multifunctionality of agriculture. In the discussion we argue that to be relevant research efforts aimed at supporting policy development for multifunctional agriculture cannot concentrate on filling gaps in knowledge and technology alone, but need to concern the process of utilization of knowledge as well. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.
