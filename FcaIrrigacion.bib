abstract = {Australia's sophisticated and advanced water market legislation has allowed direct investment by non-landholder stakeholders in water ownership, which over time has increased the volume of water entitlements owned by government, non-governmental organisations and non-landholder investors (e.g. superannuation companies, trade speculators). The growing market value of Australian water entitlements, driven by increased water scarcity and international commodity prices, has meant that water is now one of the most valuable assets owned by many irrigators. However, to date, there is no standard practise of financial water valuation and accounting, nor is there an understanding of the most common methods used by various stakeholders. We report information from 63 in-depth expert interviews with bankers, environmental water holders, financial investors/agri-corporates, property evaluators and water brokers in the Murray-Darling Basin to establish the current practices employed. The most common valuation methods used current market prices based on water register and water broker data. Water entitlements were valued with historical cost or fair value water accounting, depending on the stakeholder. However, given the lack of standardised methodology, evaluator discretion and fast moving (or thin) markets can lead to considerable divergence in water valuation values. Recommendations are made for the need for greater transparency and standardised water valuation methods.},

abstract = {Water is rising on the policy agenda as population growth and climate change intensify scarcity, shocks, and access inequalities. The conventional economic policy recommendations—privatization, pricing, and property rights—have struggled due to a failure to account adequately for the politics of water and the associated distributional conflicts. We identify distinctive social and physical characteristics of water supply and demand, and explore their implications for three central areas of water policy: financing infrastructure, pricing, and property rights reform. Growing dependence on groundwater and non-networked water supplies exacerbates these challenges and reinforces the need to rethink the economics of water and tackle the political challenges head on. Meeting the water sustainable development goals would require institutional and technological innovations to supply, allocate, and manage water, as well as a sustained political and financial commitment to address those who might be left behind.},

@article{Hsiao2007,
abstract = {As the competition for the finite water resources on earth increases due to growth in population and affluence, agriculture is faced with intensifying pressure to improve the efficiency of water used for food production. The causes for the relatively low water use efficiency in agriculture are numerous and complex, including environmental, biological, engineering, management, social, and economic facets. The complexity of the problem, with its myriads of local variations, requires a comprehensive conceptual framework of the underlying physical and biological processes as the basis to analyze the existing situation and quantify the efficiencies, and to plan and execute improvements. This paper proposes such a framework, based on the simple fact that the overall efficiency of any process consisting of a chain of sequential step is the product of the efficiency (i.e., output/input ratio) of its individual component steps. In most cases of water use, a number of process chains, both branching and merging, are involved. Means to integrate the diverging and converging chains are developed and presented as equations. Upscaling from fields to regions and beyond are discussed. This chain of efficiencies approach is general and can be applied to any process composed of chains of sequential steps. Here the framework is used to analyze the systems of irrigated and dryland crop production, and animal production on rangeland. Range of plausible efficiencies of each step is presented as tables, with values separately for the poor and for the good situation of circumstances, management and technology. Causes of the differences in efficiency of each step, going from water delivery to soil water extraction, transpiration, photosynthesis, and conversion to crop biomass and yield, and to animal product are briefly discussed. Sample calculations are made to demonstrate how modest differences in the efficiencies of the component steps are manifested as large to huge differences in the overall efficiency. Based on an equation quantifying the impact of changes in efficiency of component steps on the overall efficiency, it is concluded that generally, it is more effective to made modest improvements in several or more steps than to concentrate efforts to improve one or two steps. Hence, improvement efforts should be systematic and not overly concentrated on one or two components. The potential use of the same equation as the point of departure to optimize the allocation of economic resource among the component steps to maximize the improvement in the overall water use efficiency is elaborated on. The chain of efficiencies framework provides the means to examine the current levels of efficiency along the pathways of agricultural water use, to analyze where inefficiencies lie by comparing with the range of known efficiency values in the tables presented, to assess the potential improvements that may be achieved in various parts and their impact on the overall efficiency, and to aid in the optimal allocation of resources for improvements. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Gomez2018,
abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual framework for both assessing the role of economic instruments, and reshaping them in order to enhance their contribution to the goals of managing water scarcity. Water management problems stem from the mismatch between a multitude of individual decisions, on the one hand, and the current and projected status of water resources on the other. Economics can provide valuable incentives that drive individual decisions, and can design efficient instruments to address water governance problems in a context of conflicting interests and relevant transaction costs. Yet, instruments such as water pricing or trading are mostly based on general principles of welfare economics that are not readily applicable to assets as complex as water. A flaw in welfare economic approaches lies in the presumption that economic instruments may be good or bad on their own (e.g., finding the “right” price). This vision changes radically when we focus on the problem, instead of the instrument. In this paper, we examine how economic instruments to achieve welfare-enhancing water resource outcomes can realize their full potential in basin-scale management contexts. We follow a political economy perspective that views conflicts between public and private interest as the main instrumental challenge of water management. Our analysis allows us to better understand the critical importance of economic instruments for reconciling individual actions towards collective ambitions of water efficiency, equity and sustainability with lessons for later-adopting jurisdictions. Rather than providing panaceas, the successful design and implementation of economic instruments as key river basin management arrangements involves high transaction costs, wide institutional changes and collective action at different levels.},

Distance functions are the selected parametric technique. High-quality grapevine represents good output, and the excess of water the bad output. Excess water is measured based on applied water volume, crop requirements, soil characteristics and management practices. The model is augmented with the introduction of a spatial weighting matrix on the right-hand side. Our preliminary results point that different water sources and irrigation systems have an effect on the technical and environmental performance of the vineyards, which could be clustered through the spatial peculiarities of the territory.},

abstract = {This report offers a guide on potential reform pathways towards sustainable agriculture water use, based on a thorough review of selected past water and agriculture reforms and extensive consultation with policy experts. A theory of change is developed that emphasises the importance of flexibility in the timing and design of reform processes to achieve practical and effective policy changes. Governments should prepare future reforms, via continued research, education, and governance efforts, to help take advantage of reform opportunities when the timing is right. Five necessary conditions are identified for a successful reform process: (i) support evidence-based problem definition, objective setting and evaluations; (ii) ensure that governance and institutions are aligned with the policy change; (iii) engage stakeholders strategically and build trust; (iv) rebalance economic incentives to mitigate short run economic losses; and (v) define an adjustable smart reform sequencing that provides flexibility in the long run. These conditions are found to be necessary to implement four challenging policy changes: charging water use in agriculture; removing subsidies that negatively impact water resources, regulating groundwater use and addressing nonpoint source pollution. But the relative effort that governments need to devote to fulfilling each of the five conditions will vary depending on the policy change. Keywords:},

abstract = {Esta monograf{\'{i}}a se enmarca en el manejo de los recursos h{\'{i}}dricos en grandes redes de riego. En ella se describe el caso del r{\'{i}}o Mendoza, en la provincia hom{\'{o}}nima, el que fuera regulado en el a{\~{n}}o 2002. Este r{\'{i}}o nace en la Cordillera de los Andes, y presenta un importante arrastre de s{\'{o}}lidos en suspensi{\'{o}}n, los que actualmente son retenidos en gran medida por el embalse Potrerillos. Las “aguas claras” que se erogan del embalse producen problemas erosivos, los que a su vez estar{\'{i}}an ocasionando una mayor infiltraci{\'{o}}n en los canales, y con ello un incremento en la recarga de acu{\'{i}}feros en ciertas zonas, as{\'{i}} como problemas derivados del ascenso de la fre{\'{a}}tica en otras. Se citan procesos ocurridos en otros distritos de riego frente a la regulaci{\'{o}}n de los r{\'{i}}os, para concluir que el del r{\'{i}}o Mendoza es un caso susceptible de sufrir ciertos per- juicios, ya se{\~{n}}alados en la Manifestaci{\'{o}}n General de Impacto Ambiental del embalse Potrerillos, los que actualmente se est{\'{a}}n presentando en la red de riego. A partir de los estudios de sedimentolog{\'{i}}a en el r{\'{i}}o Mendoza, se hace un an{\'{a}}lisis t{\'{e}}cnico de los fen{\'{o}}menos asociados al cambio de las caracter{\'{i}}sticas f{\'{i}}sicas del agua. Luego se describen los procesos erosivos, de acuerdo con la hidr{\'{a}}ulica cl{\'{a}}sica. Se define la Eficiencia de conducci{\'{o}}n (Ec), la infiltraci{\'{o}}n en canales y su importancia en distintos distritos de riego, para luego mencionar los estudios realizados en el {\'{a}}rea del r{\'{i}}o Mendoza. Se analiza el desarrollo espacial que ha tenido el oasis, la escasa programaci{\'{o}}n que tuvo su traza y la antig{\"{u}}edad de la misma. La descripci{\'{o}}n de los suelos permite concluir acerca de la importancia de su estructura y del papel que juegan las porciones finas, a{\'{u}}n en minor{\'{i}}a, que integran las distintas clases texturales con respecto a la Ec. Se describen los criterios con que se distribuye el agua en Mendoza, analiz{\'{a}}ndose los caudales distribuidos actualmente, para relacionarlos con los niveles fre{\'{a}}ticos. Se mencionan adem{\'{a}}s distintas acciones encaradas por la provincia para mitigar los efectos de las aguas claras. El an{\'{a}}lisis de los m{\'{e}}todos utilizados para medir la Ec, permite apreciar el estado de la ciencia al respecto. Un an{\'{a}}lisis de las ventajas y de las desventajas de los distintos m{\'{e}}todos, y de los resultados que con ellos se obtienen, permite concluir que el m{\'{e}}todo de entradas y salidas es el que mejor se adapta en Mendoza, incluyendo adem{\'{a}}s aspectos metodol{\'{o}}gicos de la medici{\'{o}}n. Tambi{\'{e}}n se concluye en que la Ec. est{\'{a}} insuficientemente evaluada; las fracciones finas de los suelos en muchos casos gravitan m{\'{a}}s que la textura frente a la Ec; por ello, se considera que el estudio de la Ec en las distintas {\'{a}}reas de manejo es necesario para entender los procesos de revenici{\'{o}}n y recarga de acu{\'{i}}feros, y que las p{\'{e}}rdidas administrativas pueden gravitar m{\'{a}}s que la Ec. Se recomienda continuar con los trabajos de evaluaci{\'{o}}n de Ec, al ser necesarios para todas las actividades en la cuenca; se desaconseja en este r{\'{i}}o el ajuste de modelos de predicci{\'{o}}n de Ec; las caracter{\'{i}}sticas de los suelos obligan a interpretar y aplicar con criterio la bibliograf{\'{i}}a internacional, pero a{\'{u}}n as{\'{i}} no se pueden hacer generalizaciones acerca de de la Ec en Mendoza.},

abstract = {As the Argentinean grapevine production systems have gained global visibility, the wine industry has been revitalized with a greater focus on enological quality, technology adoption, and export orientation. Although grapevine production has decreased 36{\%} in a decade nationwide, the province of Mendoza accounts for 66{\%} of grapevine production and 73.3{\%} of the wine making. These changes are explained by relatively more technologically advanced production systems with a focus on quality and a higher decrease of vine hectarage in other provinces of Argentina. Small and medium size producers face scale limitations, financial constraints, and uneven access to quality irrigation water. There is a concern that vineyards fall short on their potential and that they are not optimizing their resources. The contribution of this dissertation is to unveil the underlying political and economic factors that affect the performance of vineyards and their effects on water resources. This dissertation departs from previous empirical applications by shedding light on the efficiency determinants of grapevine production and simultaneously accounting for agroecosystem characteristics and plot level information including irrigated water volumes in Mendoza, Argentina. Technical and environmental efficiency is assessed utilizing an unique dataset of 647 plots that includes, soil characterization, water volumes, and dummy variables for technology adoption and enological practices. The research considers that farmers jointly produce a desired output (grapevines) and an undesired output (saline hazard), both are dependent on the farmers' location as well as their production systems and practices. The framework allows for estimation of the directional distance function following the most fair direction; that is, increasing grapevine production while decreasing salinity hazard. Results of the estimation confirm an existing trade-off relationship between grapevine production and saline hazard. The mean economic environmental efficiency is 0.869 corresponding a mean inefficiency of 0.131.},

@article{Gomez2017,
abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual framework for both assessing the role of economic instruments, and reshaping them in order to enhance their contribution to the goals of managing water scarcity. Water management problems stem from the mismatch between a multitude of individual decisions, on the one hand, and the current and projected status of water resources on the other. Economics can provide valuable incentives that drive individual decisions, and can design efficient instruments to address water governance problems in a context of conflicting interests and relevant transaction costs. Yet, instruments such as water pricing or trading are mostly based on general principles of welfare economics that are not readily applicable to assets as complex as water. A flaw in welfare economic approaches lies in the presumption that economic instruments may be good or bad on their own (e.g., finding the “right” price). This vision changes radically when we focus on the problem, instead of the instrument. In this paper, we examine how economic instruments to achieve welfare-enhancing water resource outcomes can realize their full potential in basin-scale management contexts. We follow a political economy perspective that views conflicts between public and private interest as the main instrumental challenge of water management. Our analysis allows us to better understand the critical importance of economic instruments for reconciling individual actions towards collective ambitions of water efficiency, equity and sustainability with lessons for later-adopting jurisdictions. Rather than providing panaceas, the successful design and implementation of economic instruments as key river basin management arrangements involves high transaction costs, wide institutional changes and collective action at different levels.},

@article{Bertranou1983,
abstract = {The present paper briefly exposes several aspects related to water use, emphasizing the role of water discharge and re-use in agriculture. Mendoza is an Argentinian State located in a typical arid region. AS such, Mendoza has grown on the basis of intensive surface and ground water use, confronting today a clear overexploitation of the ground water reserves. This situation imposes a burden of increasing pumping costs and decreasing water quality for future generations. As it is well known, the common use of a natural resource (ground water reserves) is characterized by a time externality, which constitutes a market imperfection. In addition to this population growth, improvement in urban water provision and sewage services, increasing industrial water demand, etc., impose a host of problems in terms of water quantity and quality. In all these cases, it is commonly agreed, public action is required. It is our claim that most of the existing problems in relation to water use in Mendoza are common to most of the arid regions of the world. Hence, the present should constitute, at least partially, an adequate starting point for the establishment of rational guidelines in water management in arid zones. The second section of this paper contains a description of the nature of the regional water sources, centering attention on the water cycle in relation to agricultural use and its impact upon water quantity and quality. It also contains a brief description of the flood prevention system. The third section shows a characterization of the urban water provision and sewage system in the region, noticing the existing interrelationship between urban sewage and the irrigation system. A quantification of the volumes of water involved is provided. In the fourth section a similar description is made with regard to the industrial sector, where the amount of water used and an estimate of the industrial effluents organic load is advanced. A listing of social and economic impacts associated to water use and re-use in the region is presented in the fifth section, where the role and deficiencies of the present water management structure are set forth. Finally, the sixth section contains a set of recommendations aiming towards the establishment of a decision integrated management system.},

The European Commission (EC) alert about the consequences in water stressed regions that are investing heavily in modernization of irrigation networks and systems. This paper reviews the literature, linking water savings with water diversion and water depletion, both from theoretical models and empirical evidence from the published research. In order to increase knowledge of this phenomenon, a new empirical case study is presented based on a survey of 36,000 ha of recently modernized irrigated areas in the Guadalquivir basin (southern Spain). The results of the case study illustrates the conditions that may avoid rebound effect, although the results of the available empirical evidence and the published theoretical research are diverse and lead to contradictory results. Further research is therefore needed to determine the causes and solutions of water saving investment impacts and the possible speculative rebound effect.},

abstract = {Agriculture's water quality and quantity challenges continue to grow in many regions of the world. Policy solutions have been identified, but not always applied where needed nor implemented effectively. This report analyses eight past water and agriculture policy changes in OECD countries with the aim to identify steps towards adopting and implementing such solutions effectively. Selected reforms are assessed systematically via an institutional change analysis and a cross-cutting comparison of political economy factors. A characterisation of reforms is proposed according to the scope of the reform process, the scope of the reform's action, and the involvement of governments in the design of reforms and their implementation. The comparison of agriculture and water policy changes shows that introducing reforms can be facilitated by exogenous factors, including droughts and floods, and reform design features. Meanwhile, the outcome of reforms can be affected by their geographical scale and scope, the dynamic pattern of reform pathways, and compensation for farmers. There are, however, trade-offs between the effects of these factors on the reform's ambition, effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility.},

abstract = {Tube-well irrigation, through modern water extraction mechanisms (WEMs), has been vital to food security and sustainable livelihoods in India. However, due to skewed distribution of WEMs towards large farmers on account of huge investment needs, small and marginal farmers have to rely on owners of WEMs for irrigation water. This has resulted in the emergence of informal water markets. The present study has examined the groundwater extraction and water-use efficiency under different watermarket regimes in the Central Plain Zone (CPZ) of Uttar Pradesh, where water-intensive cropping pattern is followed. The study is based on the primary data collected from 100 farmer-households of Central Plain Zone in the year 2007. Most of the farmers in the study domain are small and marginal, having less than 2 ha land. These resource-poor farmers buy water from the WEM-owners. Thus, groundwater market has been found to provide them easy accessibility to irrigation water and helps them in realizing better yields. The popularity of water-intensive crops, such as paddy, wheat and sugarcane, is responsible for the depleting groundwater tables in the region. Estimates of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) have shown that both buyers and owners of WEMs are technically inefficient in water-use, as the actual use of irrigation water has been found much higher than the optimum level. However, 'Buyers have been found comparatively more efficient than 'Owners' in water utilization. Overexploitation of groundwater resources raises concerns about the future sustainability of agriculture. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly important that groundwater is used efficiently and groundwater market can emerge as a better tool for improving the efficiency of irrigation water across farm-sizes and crops. Based on the results, the study has made some policy suggestions also for an equitable and sustainable development of agriculture in the region. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Integrated hydrologic and economic optimization models at the basin scale provide a framework for policy design, implementation, and evaluation in water-stressed basins. Despite the considerable potential that basin scale analysis offers, few basin-wide studies have examined tradeoffs among efficiency, equity, and sustainability when analyzing the design of water resource programs. This paper develops a basin scale framework to identify hydrologic and economic impacts of alternative water pricing programs that comply with environmental regulations for protecting water quality. Key issues are examined that confront integrated hydroeconomic basin models: linking water and economics, spatial and temporal scale integration, and quantity-quality relationships. Economic efficiency is defined and measured for each of two urban water pricing arrangements that comply with urban water quality protection regulations. Alternative measures of equity are analyzed in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Sustainability is evaluated physically for protecting the water supply and financially for long-term revenue viability. The approach is illustrated from results of a dynamic nonlinear programming optimization model of water use in North America's Rio Grande basin. The model optimizes the net present value of the basin's total economic benefits subject to constraints on equity, sustainability, hydrology, and institutions. It is applied to assess impacts of a two-tiered pricing program that complies with recently implemented drinking water quality standards for the basin's two largest U.S. cities: Albuquerque, New Mexico, and El Paso, Texas. Results suggest that two-tiered pricing of urban water supply has considerable potential to perform well in meeting the aims of efficiency, equity, and sustainability. Findings provide a general framework for designing water pricing programs that comply with environmental regulations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Energy and water are interlinked. The development, use, and waste generated by demand for both resources drive global change. Managing them in tandem offers potential for global-change adaptation but presents institutional challenges. This paper advances understanding of the water-energy nexus by demonstrating how these resources are coupled at multiple scales, and by uncovering institutional opportunities and impediments to joint decision-making. Three water-energy nexus cases in the United States are examined: (1) water and energy development in the water-scarce Southwest; (2) conflicts between coal development, environmental quality, and social impacts in the East; and (3) tensions between environmental quality and economic development of shale natural gas in the Northeast and Central U.S. These cases are related to Eastern, Central, and Western regional stakeholder priorities collected in a national effort to assess energy-water scenarios. We find that localized challenges are diminished when considered from broader perspectives, while regionally important challenges are not prioritized locally. The transportability of electricity, and to some extent raw coal and gas, makes energy more suitable than water to regionalized global-change adaptation, because many of the impacts to water availability and quality remain localized. We conclude by highlighting the need for improved coordination between water and energy policy. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {• Latin America may well be water rich, but economic and urban growth from the last two decades has polluted freshwater resources of many countries. • Several factors such as population growth, rapid urbanization, water contamination and pollution, and increased water demands due to increased economic growth are putting considerable pressure on available water resources. Decoupling economic growth from water use is at the core of innovation strategies for sustainable consumption and production and ultimately for resource efficiency. • In LAC, as in other regions of the world, agriculture is the main user of freshwater. Within this sector about 90{\%} of the water consumption is based on green water – rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture. • The greatest opportunity for improvement in water productivity and efficiency is in rain-fed agriculture through enhanced and known management practices. • In general, irrigation efficiency of the existing systems in LAC countries is medium to low; the average irrigation efficiency for the region is reported at 39{\%}, varying between 30 and 40{\%}, whereas the world average is 56{\%}. • Urban water use in LAC also shows low technical water efficiency relative to developed countries; on average, water conveyance efficiency is reported to be 59{\%}. • Water efficiency in the electricity sector also shows significant room for improvement. • Thus LAC countries must improve water use efficiencies in order to increase water and food security as well as protect aquatic ecosystems. LAC countries must consider water policy changes that provide adequate incentives to use water resources efficiently and ultimately achieve a more sustainable use of water in all sectors.},

abstract = {In decision-making processes, reliability and risk aversion play a decisive role. This paper presents a framework for stochastic optimization of control strategies for groundwater nitrate pollution from agriculture under hydraulic conductivity uncertainty. The main goal is to analyze the influence of uncertainty in the physical parameters of a heterogeneous groundwater diffuse pollution problem on the results of management strategies, and to introduce methods that integrate uncertainty and reliability in order to obtain strategies of spatial allocation of fertilizer use in agriculture. A hydro-economic modeling approach is used for obtaining the allocation of fertilizer reduction that complies with the maximum permissible concentration in groundwater while minimizes agricultural income losses. The model is based upon nonlinear programming and groundwater flow and mass transport numerical simulation, condensed on a pollutant concentration response matrix. The effects of the hydraulic conductivity uncertainty on the allocation of nitrogen reduction among agriculture pollution sources are analyzed using four formulations: Monte Carlo simulation with pre-assumed parameter field, Monte Carlo optimization, stacking management, and mixed-integer stochastic model with predefined reliability. The formulations were tested in an illustrative example for 100 hydraulic conductivity realizations with different variance. The results show a high probability of not meeting the groundwater quality standards when deriving a policy from just a deterministic analysis. To increase the reliability several realizations can be optimized at the same time. By using a mixed-integer stochastic formulation, the desired reliability level of the strategy can be fixed in advance. The approach allows deriving the trade-offs between the reliability of meeting the standard and the net benefits from agricultural production. In a risk-averse decision making, not only the reliability of meeting the standards counts, but also the probability distribution of the maximum pollutant concentrations. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the influence of the variance of the hydraulic conductivity fields on the strategies. The results show that the larger the variance, the greater the range of maximum nitrate concentrations and the worst case (or maximum value) that could be reached for the same level of reliability. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper reviews integrative modelling approaches which were developed to analyze the impact of multifunctional agriculture, or which may be used as such. The approaches are integrative in combining multiple goals of agriculture, and confronting these with current or potential performance of agricultural land-use systems at different spatial scales. The paper focuses on France, Germany and The Netherlands, countries with a track record in quantitative systems modelling, to identify convergence of concepts and technologies applicable to assessment of multifunctional agriculture and to establish shortcomings through analysis and comparison of 15 integrative modelling cases. An analytical framework for comparison is applied, based on a conceptual model of goal-oriented evaluation of agriculture. Results demonstrate unexpectedly large differences between countries in the number of integrative models; the nature of agro-ecological or bio-economic relations used, and target audience. Common elements were a focus on methodology development rather than answering questions of specific clients, limited attention for model evaluation and impact analysis, and an imbalanced attention for economic and abiotic environmental indicators at the expense of biotic, landscape and social indicators. None of the approaches specifically addressed multifunctionality of agriculture. In the discussion we argue that to be relevant research efforts aimed at supporting policy development for multifunctional agriculture cannot concentrate on filling gaps in knowledge and technology alone, but need to concern the process of utilization of knowledge as well. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The model is applied to the Maipo river basin in Chile.

@article{Cai2003,
abstract = {With growing water scarcity and increasing competition across water-using sectors, the need for water savings and more efficient water use has increased in importance in water resources management. Improvement in the physical efficiency of water use is related to water conservation through increasing the fraction of water beneficially used over water applied, while enhancing economic efficiency is a broader concept, seeking the highest economic value of water use through both physical and managerial measures. Physical and economic efficiency measures are both useful indicators for water management at the irrigation system and river basin level. However, the relationship between physical efficiency and economic efficiency is not always clear, and the values of these measures may indicate different directions for water policy and investments in irrigation. Open research questions include, for example, the following: How does the change in responsiveness of water allocation and irrigation technology to economic incentives affect physical and economic irrigation efficiency? What is the impact of a change in irrigation system efficiency on basin physical and economic efficiency? How do changes in water withdrawals affect basin physical and economic efficiency under a given water requirement? To explore these issues, an integrated economic-hydrologic river basin model is applied to the Maipo River Basin in Chile. A series of modeling scenarios is defined, and policy implications based on changes in physical and economic efficiencies for basin-wide irrigation water management are analyzed.},

abstract = {Over the last 25 years, economic water policy models have evolved in concept, theoretical and technical methods, scope and application to address a host of water demand, supply, and management policy questions. There have been a number of theoretical and empirical advances over this period, particularly related to estimation of nonmarket, public good water-related values involving different methods of valuation. We discuss modeling advances including modeling multiple, competing demands, types of incentives and tech- nologies and behavioral responses, incorporation of groundwater and other supply alternatives, integration of institutional factors, and increasing attention to system-wide impacts. The largest changes in hydroeconomic policy models have been the integration of the individual demand and supply components, inclusion of environmental values, incorporation of governance and institutional conditions (laws, regulations and policies), and expansion to river basin and even interposing scales of analysis. Important areas of future hydroeconomic model advances will be the use of genetic and neurological based algorithms for solving dynamic, stochastic problems, reconstruction of hydrological and economic relationships for remotely sensed data, and the expansion of models to understand and address transboundary water resource economic, hydrologic, environmental and institutional policy, and interdependencies.},
